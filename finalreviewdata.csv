1,These are terrible. The charge doesn???last at all. I have to keep them constantly plugged in to use them. My inexpensive set stays charged forever. Don???waste your money.,172,0.2458,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,171.7542
2,I just needed a cheap pair of buds for walking but these were on sale for $45. I HATE these. First off they force you to download Alexa in order to use them. I can't express how much that pisses me off. Secondly; the sound quality is terrible; not remotely what I expect from buds that normally cost $150. These are worst I've ever bought; $20-30 ones couldn't have worse sound than these.,389,0.3269,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,388.6731
3,The quality of these earbuds are fairly decent. The setup was easy and the sound quality is impressive. The only thing I do not like about these and may end up returning them for is the noise cancellation and comfort. I was using them in the gym and the guy next to me was going through something with all his grunting and noises. I turned on noise cancellation and still heard him over my music. Tried turning it off and back on and honestly it made a 15% difference. The noise cancellation and comfort are the reasons I returned these.,537,0.3598,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,537.3598
4,very cheap; terrible quality! battery is terrible and it constantly has issues when charging. the music quality is good; but i am definitely going back to airpods once I have the chance.,186,0.2819,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,185.7181
5,There ok for the price I paid. Works ok getting feed back sounds. Connection is very good. They seem to be strong so far.,121,0.2349,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,120.7651
6,Won???connect to my not worth all the effort,44,0.1181,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,43.8819
7,Speakers went out after only a few uses. Wasn't able to return.,63,0.1761,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,62.8239
8,Very durable ear buds. Great value for the cost. I did not have any issues with connecting to my Razr phone. Very easy to use. Voice control and response time is unmatched.,172,0.2975,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,171.7025
9,These are a little difficult to get the right sizing; but it comes with eartips and other attachments. That being said the sound quality is decent. My only complaint is it staying in the ear as you're jogging and such.,218,0.2702,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,217.7298
10,Not working. Receiving message connected to device? I have no idea what device is being referred to. I don???see them connected any Bluetooth device I have.,156,0.1102,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,155.8898
11,I wish i would have read the reviews before purchasing; don??t waste your money. They absolutely DO NOT stay charged. And they slip out of your ears when sweaty; and since I purchased them to use while working out; this is an issue. Just don???waste your money.,261,0.3208,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,260.6792
12,Every time I go to use them; I have to reconnect them to my device through the Alexa app. Sometimes it will not even work. They have become completely useless to me. I have tried for over 30 minutes today but still not  paired. In that time; my air pods were recharged and ready to go and automatically connected. I was getting this message ??We are having trouble pairing with your device Make sure your device is powered on and ready to connect to your phone.?? No reason to have to reconnect through Alexa app each time.,523,0.1904,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,523.1904
13,Ear buds are nice; but they are connected to alexa. Only use for music at gym no phone calls :(((,97,0.2986,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,96.7014
14,This is my first time buying Amazon eacho bud. Setup was pretty easy. Good quality sound and built in Alexa is amazing; definitely buying one more for my daughter too.,167,0.2388,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,166.7612
15,Pesimos el sonido es malo el pueba de ruido no sirve de los peores son super sencibles lo tactil y a cada rato se interrumpe la musica o se pausa y para acabarla de repentente se deconecta solo del bluetooh aun teniendo bateria y no se vuelven a conectar!!,256,0.0791,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,255.9209
16,Had these about a month. Used may 6times and now the left ear bud doesn't work,78,0.2666,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,77.7334
17,They work with NOTHING; only works with Alex on a Fire tablet; worst purchase ever.,83,0.1466,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,82.8534
18,?»i've tried charging them with no luck. I had a charge; just long enough for me to pair them with my phone and Alexa. But now it's at zero percent with the red flashing light again. I've tried to reset him. By holding the button down for 15 to 30 seconds; it'll have a red; solid light for a few seconds. Then goes back to blinking red. I've tried the help desk ect with no luck,378,0.1439,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,377.8561
19,Do not shut off in charging case. None of the buds fit my ears and the ones that comes close are extremely uncomfortable. Affordable but buy something different.,161,0.2637,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,160.7363
20,Sound quality is great but disappointed on the battery life.seems shorter than my$17 other cheaper pair.,104,0.3125,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,103.6875
21,I have had JBL Buds for years. Echo buds don't compare. They are wider which doesn't fit comfortable in my small ears. The clarity and volume isn't as good as JBL and batteries die too fast. Also the Echo devices are irritating when they play a voice to tell me the battery is running out and wakes me up.,305,0.2924,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,304.7076
22,Horrible. Takes an act of congress for them to connect and they won't hold a charge very long.,94,0.1166,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,93.8834
23,It did not hold a charge. Returned. Wanted to talk with customer service,72,0.0824,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,71.9176
24,Too difficult to use. Piece of crap. Will have to order some real ones.,71,0.1638,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,70.8362
25,You have to download the Alexa app to use these earbuds; something I didn't realize when I bought them and don't like. I just wanted earbuds-- not to be connected to big tech. But the real deal breaker is that they aren't compatible with my iPod; which is what I run with. You can't download the newest Alexa app on the iPod; and the older version doesn't work. The iPod recognized the earbuds but Spotify wouldn't play sound through them.,439,0.1872,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,438.8128
26,Decent audio quality; but they are prone to bad connection in the case. Right bud eventually got worse in quality; and then started giving off a high pitched screech when being put in or removed.,195,0.3164,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,194.6836
27,Absolute waste of money; these are complete junk. Its stupid that you cant just use them as a bluetooth device and that you have to download an app; i should be able to pair them right out of the box. The sound quality is sub par. The fit is terrible they fall out very easily not because of the rubber part in your ear being loose; but because their weight is very lopsided and unbalanced. The tap controls are way too sensitive; cant use them under a snowboard helmet. After not even a week of use; the left earbud has shrieking ear piercing feedback so now i only use the right earbud. Takes an insanely long time to connect to the phone when you go to use them; every other bluetooth headphone ive ever used connects in half the time or less. Also has an annoying bug where it will be connected for calls only and not audio as well; have to boot it off and reconnect it to fix. Worst headphones ive ever purchased in my life.,929,0.3506,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,929.3506
28,I??¶e had these for a little over a month now and without any hesitation these are the worst bluethooth headphones I??¶e owned. It fits okay in the ear especially with the extra pieces of your tips they add for different size of ears; but if you??±e using them to listen to music while you work a shift; you might as well buy wired headphones or waste money on some actual good AirPods or better Bluetooth headphones I recommend these if only you were using them to control other items in your home other than that; they are horrible for to basic small things as working running and basically anything that takes more than a hour I??¶e literally put them on and not even an hour later. It???notifying that it???running low on battery DO NOT BUY,740,0.3257,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,740.3257
29,Left earbud cuts out when I run.,32,0.1939,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,31.8061
30,You get a lot of bang for you buck with these. They're very compact; sound pretty good; and the noise cancellation is great. I've found myself always popping them in on any long flights across the US. Whenever you turn off the noise cancellation; it's always shocking just how loud it is inside the plane. I think my only real complaint is how slick the case is. I'm always afraid I'm going to drop it under the seat or something.,430,0.2805,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,429.7195
31,Junk. Feels cheap. Battery doesn???even hold a few days without use. Imagine having to have your earbuds on the charger constantly even if you only use them every couple days. For how much these cost I was expecting more.,221,0.2638,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,220.7362
32,I got these as a back-up pair during Prime Days for $45. I use earbuds a lot and have several pairs from different manufacturers. My go-to everyday buds are Air Pod Pros but since these Echo buds were a fraction of the price; I thought I'd give them a try. A couple of things to note: I'm not an Alexa user and these are Alexa enabled buds. Think Siri if you're an Apple user - but since there's no 'Alexa phone' you're connecting to; you have to actually setup the Alexa app on your phone and configure these ear buds. I almost returned them because they worked out of the box but then didn't work because I hadn't set them up properly. The sound quality is decent; so is the battery life; but the size of the buds in your ears is larger than I'd like - substantially larger than my my other go-to Studio Beats and my Air Pods. They'll connect to multiple devices and switch automatically which is nice; but have an odd quick in that while you're listening with them they'll disconnect from one of the devices by themselves for no reason and without any movement of the buds and the connected devices (e.g. me sitting on my bed with connected iPhone and iPad both on my nightstand 2 ft away). When they disconnect; one of the ear buds loses connectivity which is annoying and requires manually reconnecting to the device you're listening to or even having to turn Bluetooth off and then back on and then reconnecting. Summary: Sound and battery life are decent; Alexa is an annoyance for me since I'm not an Alexa user; and they're clunky in terms of size and fit. These buds go in my bag as a third or fourth string pair when my others are out of juice. In terms of value for the money; at $45 they were a good deal but if I'd paid $145 I probably would've returned them. There are lots of good ear bud choices out there these days and too many better alternatives at that $145-$150 price point. I gave them a 3-Star rating only because they were decent value for what I paid. I would've given 2 stars if I'd paid full price. Sorry Amazon.,2041,0.2983,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,2041.2983
33,Terrible for running. They pop every step and returning them is nearly impossible even though it???still within the return window. Stick to AirPods.,148,0.2834,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,147.7166
34,These are not very well made unfortunately they were very disappointing. Even with the adapters; they keep falling out. I wanted to buy them to work out and they have fallen out at at least a half a dozen times. If you??±e just sitting then they??±e fine but if you??±e moving around; I would not recommend them.,309,0.2119,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,308.7881
35,The sound quality is average at best. I got it connected to the Alexa app the day I received it then I tried to use them again a few days later and they wouldn???connect at all. Unfortunately; they won???work at all if they aren???connected to Alexa. I would look at Soundcore or other cheap earbud options.,307,0.255,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,306.745
36,Sound quality is a non-issue since they don't work consistently. Headphones frequently disconnect for no reason. I manually reconnect only to have them disconnect again 5 seconds later. Over and over. They connect the first time and stay connected maybe 30% of the time. These are so frustrating to TRY to use. Returning today,326,0.3,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,325.7
37,Horrible product horrible return policy for a company that makes the headphones! Never buy Amazon products,106,0.264,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,105.736
38,Excellent sound quality; the noise cancelling function is truly a taste of modern technology but... I had to replace them twice and they were only used in the office for conference calls or blocking out the noisy cubical neighbors that like to listen to rock radio all day... occasionally coworkers liked to have dB wars with the country music enjoyers and these earbuds were great for blocking the whole show out. In the end; they turned out to be a waste of silicon and lithium because I went through two pairs in under a year due to irritating noises during malfunction (loud popping; odd/painful pressure changes in the ears),629,0.3402,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,629.3402
39,Not even one star. Can???get this to pair and work with any device. The online assistance is worthless. Biggest waste of money IMO.,131,0.1187,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,130.8813
40,Great price; great sound and alexa compatible. Quality is on par with high priced brands and low cost makes this a no brainer,125,0.2477,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,124.7523
41,The sound of these earbuds is fine. The controls are basic and work. The problem?? The fit and the instructions on how to get a correct fit are a FAIL! I tried different sizes of the tips plus the optional wings. I cannot find a position that prevents these from constantly falling out when doing mild exercise or walking around. I am not running or working out vigorously ( I am a Senior). The help video appears to be easy to follow. However; when followed; the ear bud are not in the position they are supposed to be in. So either I have weird ear canals or these are the worst design ear buds. I have hearing aids (not used with the ear buds) and have used ear buds in the past; but never have I esperienced so much difficulty in getting a comfortable fit that will stay in.,778,0.2955,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,778.2955
42,After sitting idle for a few days; buds will not turn on and case is completely discharged. Once charging; the buds will connect; however the case is dead. Poor battery life.,174,0.1912,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,173.8088
43,Actually a horribly made product; first you are required to download and run Thier app; which is disgustingly pathetic that's legal. Then if the charging station runs out of batteries you can't use them; not the headphones the thing that charges them. This is made to be faulty; obvious issues like headphones relying on the charger to even work is a known tactic to get people to have to re buy when either one breaks. But then again this company is known for screwing over the shoppers to make money,501,0.2125,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,501.2125
44,Sound is okay but the battery life is terrible. I can use my old echo buds for weeks without a charge and these are at 60% after a 5 mile walk. They also aren???nearly as comfortable in my ears as the older buds. Pretty disappointed in them.,241,0.3272,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,240.6728
45,I've had for over a week and love these buds. Hands down a better fit for my ears than Airpods. Sound is above expectations.,124,0.3552,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,123.6448
46,I found these very tough to use. Although it is a high quality product; it was hard for me to get it linked through the alexa app and would not connect to my spotify,165,0.2436,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,164.7564
47,These are awful; Do not buy these! The battery life is a joke; they last less than 4 hours; and the case does not hold a charge for longer than a day. Overpriced; the sound quality is mediocre. Not worth the ridiculous price point. These do not have a normal mode; they only have noise canceling or passthrough. Difficult to get working due to the requirements of using the Alexa app; but the app doesn't even let you control them in the slightest. Connecting them to your device is also counterintuitive and not user friendly.,527,0.2966,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,527.2966
48,I really liked how it fits but keep needing to charge them around every two hours which is kinda annoying,105,0.2322,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,104.7678
49,Like all amazon devices; it never works right. Just buy anything else. JBLs or whatever the youtubers are selling are better,124,0.1867,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,123.8133
50,The setup and software was easy. It integrates surprisingly well with the app and connecting them was easier than traditional Bluetooth earbuds. However; my left earbud came without an charge and it will not charge. Amazon refunded me for them but I was disappointed not to be able to use them. The right earbud works well. They are comfortable and have decent sound quality for the price point.,395,0.2709,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,394.7291
51,DO NOT BUY!!!! Worst product I've ever had! You need to get the Alexa app; which crashed my computer. Then once setup the earbuds would not work! Such a POS.,157,0.2506,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,156.7494
52,The sound is pretty good; but the noise cancellation is almost unnoticeable! The only way I know it is on is the voice that says it is on. Lot's of sound get through; like a paper bag being rustled; a leaf blower; people talking somewhat nearby and the rest of most everything going on around me. At least Alexa works.,318,0.2151,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,317.7849
53,Awesome sound. Very surprised of the great sound and performance!! Great buy!!,78,0.2331,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,77.7669
54,Forces you to use an app for base level earbud functionality; most likely to harvest your data. You're paying $100 to have your data harvested,142,0.1942,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,141.8058
55,Huge improvement over the previous model! I am really impressed! Works better with Alexa; easier to pair; and the wingtips make the fit really secure!,150,0.2289,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,149.7711
56,Got these 6 months ago and the right ear bud is no longer charging. It is under warranty but Amazon does not seem to want you to be able to exercise the warranty.,162,0.2574,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,161.7426
57,Problem staying connected to phone,34,0.0875,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,33.9125
58,Never used because left earbud won't hold a charge,50,0.2546,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,49.7454
59,These are so bad. You have to sign up on the Alexa app to use them and give permission to Alexa to listen to you which has nothing to do with headphones. Also the noise cancellation is horrendous. I regret my purchase. I??ªl never use these,239,0.2839,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,238.7161
60,Why ECHO buds can???be connected to any or all devices unless you pay a weekly/yearly fee? Product clarity and audio level quality is nominal at best!!!,152,0.21,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,151.79
61,These do not work. I spent 2 hours trying to connect the earbuds to my phone. I read through each troubleshooting forum and still received the same result ??Ÿonnection failed?? I will be returning,195,0.2907,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,194.7093
62,Amazon should take this product off the shelf. These are the worst ear buds I have ever used. And I've been using ear buds for over 30 years. Problem 1: Connectivity is so convoluted. Even the Amazon Help person I worked with was perplexed. After 90 minutes connection happened. Problem 2: I used every fitting solution they provided; varied sizes of rubber ear attachments; the extra band aid piece (that you have to take off the rubber ear attachment before you can put the band aid on). Then; every time my head moves; one of the ear pods pops out and I'm looking for it somewhere on the floor. It's a nightmare best to be avoided.,634,0.3082,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,634.3082
63,If you plan on using these for phone calls do not get them. No one can hear me. By far the worst earbuds I have gotten for calls. The cheaper Amazon earbuds are better quality than these only problem is that they would hurt. Also; the Alexa would come up thinking I was asking a question every time the wind would hit the earbud.,329,0.3149,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,328.6851
64,Used them twice before they died. These do not hold a charge; just drain to 0% even when closed in the case and not connected to anything. Worthless.,149,0.1716,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,148.8284
65,Returned; bad quality and terrible connection; keeps losing connection over and over,84,0.1372,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,83.8628
66,Garbage. I can't connect to my phone for some reason. And since I can't even do that; it won't let me set them up; and therefore cannot connect to any device. They are worthless.,178,0.1658,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,178.8342
67,Better than airpod pro 1st edition,34,0.2339,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,33.7661
68,When it works; it's great. Unfortunately it needs almost constant charging. Amazon must know this as the return window is only one month! It also loses charge quit quickly when not in use.,188,0.1769,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,187.8231
69,They don't seem to stay in ears. Sound is ok,44,0.3199,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,43.6801
70,They sent me a pair that doesn't even work. The blue light won't even turn on when I'm trying to connect them. I'm sure echo buds work good but my pair was broken. Amazon you need to learn how to package things like this and not have your delivery drivers just throw stuff on the ground.,287,0.2327,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,286.7673
71,The product is overall good. When they put the headphones back in the box and they close it; the phone is still playing through them.,133,0.2971,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,132.7029
72,They only lasted 4 months; the right earbud stopped working; and aside from that; they won't pair now. do not purchase; they still have a long way to go with these earbuds; much improvement needed. Not recommended. I paid the full price of $139.00 at the time of purchase; No customer service available; you go from one scenario to another to fix it; but there's no fix as the earbuds simply stopped working.,408,0.3411,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,407.6589

74,I've had this earphone since they came out and purchased it on a previous years Black Friday deal. I've mainly used it for listening to my Amazon Prime music when I am working out or running paired to my Samsung Galaxy phone. I've found the sound quality decent for it's price and you can use your device/smartphone's EQ to adjust the bass or treble to your listening preference (e.g. more mids or more lows). The battery life is decent as well as I never let it go below 50 %. I have it connected in my portable battery charger when it needs to be topped. It's an earphone that I keep in my Timbuktu/work out bag. The earphone is sufficient for what I need it for. I never used it for making calls so I have not tested it's microphone quality for calls nor use the voice command with Alexa or Google.,801,0.3103,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,801.3103
75,The audio quality is the best part of these. I'd say the quality is maybe slightly better than galaxy buds (maybe). I've had my original galaxy buds for a while and really like them; so I compare these to those. The echo buds fit in my ears to where I know they won't fall out; but I can't help but to want to push them farther in my ears. When I do this; I hear a ring in the ear piece like maybe I'm doing something I'm not supposed to; but I really want them to go in farther. It's slightly unsatisfying. I love that these have Alexa built in without having to press anything. That can be a game changer. One other thing I don't like about these is the touch response. The delay is too long. There's a response tone; but that doesn't sound immediately after you press it. There's an awkward delay; and then it reacts. If you don't successfully press the echo buds where you should; you won't know for a while because nothing will happen. If it had an immediate response tone like the galaxy buds it would be way more convenient. Speaking of late responses... if you program the volume up and down on the buds; it will only react one press at a time; meaning if you want to continuously turn the volume up or down; you have to hold the echo buds down. Wait for it to respond late. It will turn the volume up or down once. Then you have to let it go and do the same thing again for it to turn the volume up or down once again. (And There's no response tone for this) You can't just continue to hold it down and expect the volume to keep going up or down. This is really annoying. Imagin being on a bike and wanting to turn the volume continuously up or down ??? I cant have these as my main ear buds because of the negatives. I do love The sound quality and the idea that Alexa is built in though.,1798,0.3192,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,1798.3192
76,First; I bought these because I thought I'd lost my Pixel Pro Buds. Which of course; turned up again well after I'd gotten the Echo buds. The Echo buds don't fit quite as well as the Pixels. They feel more like they could fall out of my ears if I was jogging (well; since that'll never happen in this lifetime; they're probably safe). The sound quality is only about 70% as good as the Pixels. I spent a long time in radio; thru High School and College; and then after college; I also did video game voices in the 90's. (Mitsurugi in Soul Calibre II; anyone?) And I do a bit of video production/editing. So; I'm pretty picky about my sound and usually I want a good set of wired; over the ear head phones. The Pixel Buds were pleasantly surprising. The Echo Buds I can really only give a 'meh; they're fine'. Lastly; battery life. IT'S TERRIBLE. The Pixel Buds will go for hours; then their battery case will pep them up for another long listening session easily. The Echo Buds are practically drained after 45 minutes of a podcast; and their battery case can barely bring them back once. Their case does have wireless charging; to its credit. HOWEVER. The case is MADDENING. To pair them; you have to have the lid of the case open and then press a button on the back of the case. Pretty standard process. But the lid of the case SNAPS SHUT IF YOU BREATHE ON IT; thereby apparently interrupting the pairing process. I had to try about 5 times sitting in my car because my tablet had come un-paired and the damned lid kept snapping shut on me. All in all; I think there are probably better buds out there for the price. I got my Pixel buds included when I bought my Pixel 8 phone (thanks; Best Buy); but I'd buy them again. If I lose the Echo buds; I'm not going to bother replacing them.,1787,0.3209,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,1787.3209
77,These are a little difficult to get the right sizing; but it comes with eartips and other attachments. That being said the sound quality is decent. My only complaint is it staying in the ear as you're jogging and such.,218,0.2702,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,217.7298
78,You have to download the Alexa app to use these earbuds; something I didn't realize when I bought them and don't like. I just wanted earbuds-- not to be connected to big tech. But the real deal breaker is that they aren't compatible with my iPod; which is what I run with. You can't download the newest Alexa app on the iPod; and the older version doesn't w,357,0.1927,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,356.8073
79,I ordered two pairs of these . The black colored ones and the white colored ones . after using them for about a month I like the noise cancelling; the fit isn???bad once you figure out which earbud fits best for you . The complaint I have is the battery life . It is horrible . Even with Siri and stuff turned off the earbuds last maybe 4-5 hours . With the noise cancelling on and the Siri function turned off they last maybe closer to 6 but honestly it isn???that much of a difference battery life time . Another issue I have is when i receive a text or notification or call the volume on the earbuds gets really loud or really quiet automatically and I have to manually adjust the volume for the music or video I am watching after the call or text message notification is gone . For the price they are ??Žk??but having to change out earbuds every 4-6 hours can be a hassle.,875,0.322,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,875.322
80,Sound quality is great but disappointed on the battery life.seems shorter than my$17 other cheaper pair.,104,0.3125,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,103.6875
81,Excellent sound quality; the noise cancelling function is truly a taste of modern technology but... I had to replace them twice and they were only used in the office for conference calls or blocking out the noisy cubical neighbors that like to listen to rock radio all day... occasionally coworkers liked to have dB wars with the country music enjoyers and these earbuds were great for blocking the whole show out. In the end; they turned out to be a waste of silicon and lithium because I went through two pairs in under a year due to irritating noises during malfunction (loud popping; odd/painful pressure changes in the ears),629,0.3402,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,629.3402
82,First day; so who knows what'll happen; but so far they're great. Sounds are crisp and clear; ANC is actually pretty good - very noticeable when I tested with white noise playing out of my nearby Alexa device. Tap controls are nice. I found my best fit with the small wingtips + yellow/largest tips; if that helps anyone else. Update: Had these for 2 weeks now; so here's my updated thoughts. I still love them - great price for great buds. If I had to buy them again; I would. Sound is clear; bluetooth connection is good/never drops on me; and overall I'm quite pleased. I want to note that the ANC will dampen sounds; but not eliminate them; not that I expected that anyway; but it needs to be said. I bought these primarily so I could conduct Zoom meetings and step away from my laptop - to make a drink; eat something; go to the bathroom; etc. And for that purpose; they're perfect; they've fulfilled my expectations,921,0.3235,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,921.3235
83,Very durable ear buds. Great value for the cost. I did not have any issues with connecting to my Razr phone. Very easy to use. Voice control and response time is unmatched.,172,0.2975,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,171.7025
84,There ok for the price I paid. Works ok getting feed back sounds. Connection is very good. They seem to be strong so far.,121,0.2349,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,120.7651
85,Decent audio quality; but they are prone to bad connection in the case. Right bud eventually got worse in quality; and then started giving off a high pitched screech when being put in or removed. I would recommend a different brand for the price.,246,0.3269,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,245.6731
86,Surprisingly the noise cancellation and pass through works pretty well. The ease of use of them and the style is decent; connectivity is a toss up because they randomly disconnect per session I use. Being only under $50 is a good value for money; at regular selling price it is a horrible price. The music sounds nice and clear. They do fall out of my ear; I guess I have small ears or here's that are not normal. They fit snug in there; using the wings it feels like they put the hardest rubber silicone naked fine because after using them they absolutely hurt my ears pulling them out to put them on the charger. Another thing about those Wing things is sometimes it is difficult to have them charge. They look like they are installed correctly and I'm not that much of an idiot,780,0.3506,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,780.3506
87,So many devices and so much technology that many times it is just overwhelming. New tablet; new phone; new drone; new earbuds! I bought these over a month ago and at first I would have to say that these Amazon earbuds were not what I expected. This is my first pair of earbuds so I have nothing to compair. They were difficult to pair and the instructions did not match the model so I struggled for hours until I found the magic button on the back of the charging case. Then they paired instantly but the instructions did not even say there was a button on the back though very well hidden. I changed earbud sizes and those little cage things that eventually took off. Mowed the lawn with them with my phone on my belt. Noise cancelling did not seem to matter on or off but hey; it's a lawnmower. I put these in the drawer and waited for a day that I could go back to trying these again before writing a review. It is not fair to anyone to write a reveiw for a product that truly sits in a drawer. Today is that day my friends. Pulled these out since I was going to vaccum the house. I pulled up a cool Youtube concert on my Smart TV which I had paired these earbuds to previously and proceeded to vaccum the house. Now I am impressed. The new Bluetooth 5.0 radios reached the far corners of my 3 level home with hardly an interuption. The sound quality is really good for such tiny speakers. Good separation in the base; mid's and treble. A bit of a thump even in the base! Very clear and wide range from low to high frequencies. I did not think I would eventually like these but voila! I still have alot to learn about them and Alexa but I will get there. These are comfortable to wear; don't heat your ears up and has a good battery life. Type C charging; cool charging case that holds a charge for weeks; too. I am so glad that I kept them and gave them a chance to really shine. For the money I would highly recommend.,1923,0.2986,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,1923.2986
88,I originally had the AirPod style echo buds??. they were decent. Didn???stay in place very well but stayed. But these noise cancelling ones are insane. I always thought this style would be ??†eavy??in my ear?? But they are lite and no matter how hard I shake my head they stay in place. I must admit these are the best earbuds I have had next to my around the neck LG headset I use to cut grass with. I only gave 4 stars cuz I have only had them now for like 15 mins??,467,0.3296,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,466.6704
89,good ear buds. sound quality is awesome. there are times it disconnects from my phone and alexa doesn't work as intended. Hope this will resolve in the future. I was able to troubleshoot but did waste my time. battery life is great and can go for hours without charging. maybe days.,282,0.3503,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,281.6497
90,You get a lot of bang for you buck with these. They're very compact; sound pretty good; and the noise cancellation is great. I've found myself always popping them in on any long flights across the US. Whenever you turn off the noise cancellation; it's always shocking just how loud it is inside the plane. I think my only real complaint is how slick the case is. I'm always afraid I'm going to drop it under the seat or something.,430,0.2805,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,429.7195
91,I use several different wireless ear buds for listening to music and podcasts when hiking or traveling. The 2nd generation Echo Buds sound slightly better than average. Good bass; midrange and highs. I would describe them as having a balanced sound--unlike some other brands I've tried that have exaggerated bass or a hump in the midrange that initially sounds great but can be tiring. I play music and have a home recording studio; and I think these earbuds are really good for music or podcasts. I haven't used the Alexa integration or voice recognition tools enough to have a strong opinion on these qualities. On the downside; I have found that if I'm sweating a lot; the active noise cancellation will drop in and out in an annoying way. I believe this is related to sweat entering my ear canal because it seems to only happen on warm days or at the end of a long walk. Integration with an iPhone has not been a problem in terms of bluetooth connections. Recommended.,972,0.2862,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,972.2862
92,Love/hate these buds. Battery sucks!!! I get about 2 hours of use of them before having to put them back in the case when I'm on break; but I listen to music loud half the time while I work. They charge pretty quick and sound is good enough if your working. Definitely not a Bose or Beats. I do like making myself look crazy talking to myself/Alexa while customers walk by me. Needs a better battery for sure,408,0.3145,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,407.6855
93,I have used these for 200+ hours over the past couple of months. These are good; really; I use them a lot - but there are couple of issues though that I have. First being that they do not fit my ears; no matter what tip I use I cannot get the 'Great' fit test; only 'Good'. Second; after running and sweating in these and changing tips so often to try to get a good fit; the main tip size I use for my left ear occasionally breaks off and gets lodged in my ear with very little force if I am adjusting the buds while using them.,528,0.308,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,528.308
94,Absolute waste of money; these are complete junk. Its stupid that you cant just use them as a bluetooth device and that you have to download an app; i should be able to pair them right out of the box. The sound quality is sub par. The fit is terrible they fall out very easily not because of the rubber part in your ear being loose; but because their weight is very lopsided and unbalanced. The tap controls are way too sensitive; cant use them under a snowboard helmet. After not even a week of use; the left earbud has shrieking ear piercing feedback so now i only use the right earbud. Takes an insanely long time to connect to the phone when you go to use them; every other bluetooth headphone ive ever used connects in half the time or less. Also has an annoying bug where it will be connected for calls only and not audio as well; have to boot it off and reconnect it to fix. Worst headphones ive ever purchased in my life.,929,0.3506,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,929.3506
95,very convenient having alexa on the go. really easy to set up and works just like any other echo device. didnt have great noise cancellation. i would probably say that its not really worth it when you could just get like some other earbuds for half the price and use siri and spotify.,284,0.2276,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,283.7724
96,I had to return my 2nd Gen echo buds. I sleep with my earbuds. If you do too; these are not for you. Because the battery does not last through the night; a verbal low battery warning will wake you up - at least twice. According to Amazon support; this otherwise useful feature cannot be disabled or silenced for nighttime use. I hate to say it; but this is exactly the type of detail Apple gets right. That said; these best the Apple EarPods on every other metric. They fit way better even without the included ??—ings.??The Echo Buds did not fall out of my ears. The EarPods Pro have a widespread problem of falling out easily. The noise canceling is excellent; no better or worse than EarPods. The price of the Echo Buds is better. The case is better. The instructions are easy and the setup worked like a charm. The sound quality was about the same as my EarPods; maybe better. The Echo buds have a lower profile. This means I can lay on a pillow without hurting my ear. If only they would not wake me up five hours later. Battery life is not great but understandable due to the small size. Even with my audio set to go off an hour after I start to go to sleep; the Buds??noise canceling function drains the battery down in about five hours. Alexa works great on these. Tap-to-control functions are easy and customizable. Overall; I would recommend these over the Apple EarPods so long as you don???regularly sleep with them. If you like to sleep with your earbuds; these will wake you every five hours without any way to silence it for bed. I hate to have to return these because they are otherwise excellent; but that is a necessary issue for the way I need to use them. I suspect many of you would want the ability to silence the warnings too. Maybe a future update can address. In the meantime; I???back to my poor-fitting Apple EarPods.,1843,0.3033,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,1843.3033
97,Great product. Fits a little weird in the ear. But other than that I love them.,79,0.3346,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,78.6654
98,Fit good; sound pretty good though nowhere close to a good pair of over ear headphones. they connected super easy to my tablet and seem to connect correctly every time again without needing to use the Alexa app again. The downside is I don't think they can connect to anything with Bluetooth that doesn't have Alexa on it to set it up first. I tried to connect to my TVs Bluetooth and was unsuccessful,401,0.307,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,0,400.693
99,I have two sets of these; one with the wireless charging base and one with the normal case. The ANC on these is pretty flakey. I wear them while cutting the grass. Most of the time it isn't great and you still hear the mower. Then there will be a gust of wind and shazam the ANC kicks in great for a short while. The other super annoying thing is the 'charging case.' Both of mine have a serious flaw that makes them pretty useless to me. If you use the earbuds and then put them back in the case; the case will recharge the earbuds. Great right? No; because the cause is left with zero charge; and when you open the case and put the earbuds back in your ears; they will not turn on. Apparently; the case is what turns the earbuds on; and it can only do so while it has some charge left in it. So; to use the earbuds you have to put the case back on the wireless charger or plug it in to a charger to give it enough power to turn the earbuds on. This in my opinion negates the whole purpose of a charging case. The Alexa integration is nice; but I regret not spending a little more for a better-quality product.,1111,0.2494,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,1111.2494
100,I purchased these echo buds on prime day. And after going back and forth between these and some other higher name brands; since they were all on sale; I ultimately decided to give these a try. And honestly after reading some of the reviews I was a little nervous. But I already own AirPods Pro so I was okay buying cheaper/something more reasonable money wise. After an easy set up I???happy with this purchase. I???surprised at the sound quality I wasn???expecting much but wow the sound quality is pretty good. Not top of the line obviously but way better than some other cheaper ones. Now the ANC/pass through is not the best I like the pros ANC/transparent mode better but even still nothing to make me want to return these. I do agree with reviewers who mentioned a low hissing sort of noise when pass through is turned on but only when there???nothing playing did I find I can hear the noise. I do wish these had a longer battery life but again I???use to the 5 hrs. since it???the same as the pros and the case does prolong the battery so it???fine. These also are pretty good when working out I??¶e used them a few times now and have had no problems. Now I did see some people say some things about surrendering privacy but I had no issues with that. There is an option to mute the mics. And during the set up process I did not have to grant alexa complete access to my phone so I don???know what???going on with that. Overall I???very happy with this purchase. Glad to have a another set of wireless earbuds.,1516,0.3263,earbuds,Amazon Echo Buds with Active No,1,1516.3263
1,Excellent earbuds! The sound quality is outstanding?ë´¨ust as good; if not better; than talking directly on the phone. The noise cancelling is top-notch; background noise completely disappears; making calls and music crystal clear.,229,0.3554,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,228.6446
2,The Item is actually not okay ; the left earbud stopped charging; after that; the second stopped charging.,106,0.2336,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,105.7664
3,Excellent audio and product quality in general,46,0.3181,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,45.6819
4,The product is excellent but its price is 599 dirhams and two days later I found the price is 475. I want to make up for the difference; not an American version; an Emirati version. The product description is inaccurate,219,0.0806,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,218.9194
5,Overall the Buds3 Pro works very well when paired with the Samsung S25 Ultra. The mic works really well with the Samsung AI. Calls are clear on both ends; even when driving in a car at 60mph with the windows down. Downside is the fit. Why are manufacturers still using the 20+ year old bud that inserts in to the ear. These fall out when talking; or chewing. I am having to push them in often. Wish they would use an in-ear wind like Bose and Jara to keep them in place. The active noise cancelling is good; as long as you keep them pushed in. I would be happy with a design like an ear plug; make the neck of the bud longer so it goes into the ear canal further. Lack of a neck is also annoying. I do not want them in the ear all of the time; but when I take them out I have to put them down somewhere or in my pocket. Would be nice to have a small loop and offer a lanyard to go with them. Lastly; they are not multi-device compatible; unless you use all Samsung devices. I have my Samsung phone and my PC. I have to turn off bluetooth on the phone to connect them to the PC. Then disconnect from the PC and turn on BT to reconnect to my phone. I was surprised at the ease of use for the touch controls. I like the pinch to pause/play and long pinch to answer/hang up.,1270,0.2754,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,1270.2754
6,Much better than I expected and I think part of that has to do with 2 drivers (speakers) per earbud. My go to buds had been the NuraTrue Pro which is now Denon and I still use them. Both have a unique clarity in their own way but are not too much different overall. Buds 3 Pro might just have a little more clarity and bass due to the fact of 2 drivers. Would definitely recommend them; especially since the price has dropped. Like any other electronic device; and there are plenty; it comes down to personal preference and of course; price. They are very light in your ears and to me are comfortable for quite a while.,619,0.2899,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,619.2899
7,I'm giving them 4 stars mainly because of Samsung themselves ive had them for around 2 months there is a small crack forming where the 2 pieces come together nothing bad they still work fine. ' Buy the protection plan i didnt' i called them thinking to myself i know i didnt do it I've never dropped them or anything like that. They told me that its physical damage and it will cost 177.53 to have them fixed mind you they still work like they did when i got them which is great. My point is to buy the plan its worth it. They are probably sound wise some of the best the anc is great and i think with adjustment you can make the ambient sound just like you dont have buds in. The battery life is kinda weak with anc on maybe 5hrs. They connect fast with my s25. They are comfortable but i seem like i am alaways moving them around in my ears not that they are falling out they just move around allot.,901,0.3327,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,901.3327
8,they do fit good and ive never had a problem with them falling out. ive worn them for hours at a time and never had any discomfort at all. initially i had bought anti slip ear covers to go with them but with the silicone tips; it really isnt necessary. when they are fully charged; im happy with the battery life and the noise cancellation is decent. not the best but decent. mostly i have used them for listening to audible while driving for work and with the window down there are just brief moments i can hear the wind noise. and when ive used them for phone calls ive never gotten a complaint from anyone they couldnt hear me clearly. the issue i have with them is the charging functionality is just garbage. first; they are supposed to be wireless charging capable. which they seem to be IF you dont put any cover on it. i have tried several covers for the charging case and even a thin silicone cover just to protect from scratches interferes with wireless charging. i never had that problem with the samsung buds 2. second; literally half the time i put the ear buds in the case i either get a notification on my phone that charging stopped or; even worse; one ear bud will charge and the other doesnt and there is no notification for that. you just put the earbuds in and discover one isnt charged so it isnt working. i used my buds 2 for three or four years and cant remember a single time they didnt charge in the case. these things; like i said; half the time there is one issue or another with them charging. being honest; i find myself using a $35 pair of skullcandy earbuds or a pair of $30 soundcore earbuds more often because they sound as good as these and i never have to worry if they charged or not. nothing else really matters about them if charging them is a constant hassle.,1797,0.3195,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,1797.3195
9,These buds are quite excellent; in terms of fit and stability; sound quality and battery life. I didn't need to use the equalizer at all to get a good sound. However; the ANC produces a slight hiss or background noise that probably shouldnt be there during use. Turning it on and off and adjusting its intensity sometimes corrects for that.,340,0.2858,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,339.7142
10,I was skeptical at first because I've read reviews before I purchased. I couldn't find any of the problems I read from other users and in the end i think these are great buds. I use them at the gym and they don't slide out my ear when I'm sweating like the generation of galaxy buds before these.,296,0.3227,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,295.6773
11,Exactly what my husband was looking for. Sound quality is excellent. He loves the active noise cancellation. When it???on but no music is playing you can still hear a bit; but as soon as there???music or anything else it drowns out the noise. Best part is they don???fall out of his ears and they feel comfy.,308,0.3065,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,307.6935
12,Excellent unless you have small ears. In that case they will hurt as the buds are HUGE,86,0.3039,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,85.6961
13,These are solid earbuds. I mow lawns for a living so noise cancelling is a must. On a mower it's pretty good but weed eating it lets some noise through. The call quality is super good; I can talk on the phone with a mower at almost full throttle and my voice carries through. The fit is okay; but I've had better. But overall a great buy.,338,0.2979,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,337.7021
14,Good quality sound but the ANC is better on the Sony WF-1000XM5. I bought these for the advertised interpreting feature; but found out later any pair of earbuds will work with it. The new shape makes for a loose fit for me. I had to buy some ear hook covers to get a better fit and they fit great now. Depending on the brand; you can find ear hooks that will fit in the charging case *if* you bend the hooks in towards the center a little and *if* you get a locking case for the charger to keep the top closed. Controls are pretty simple. swipe up and down for volume. one stem squeeze to pause/play. Two stem squeezes to go one song forward and three to go one song back. Same functionality on both right and left earbuds. I haven't figured out if it's possible to customize and use one of the earbuds to toggle ANC/Ambient sound yet. Currently just using the app on my phone. I also like that it works with Samsung's SmartThings ecosystem and has a convenient location/find feature.,984,0.2961,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,984.2961
15,When on sale (like $180) these earbuds are my favorite of all the Samsung buds. I've had the Galaxy earbuds 2 and the 2 Pro; but the 3 Pro are a perfect mix of having that amazing clear flat sound that the 2 pros have while still having that low vibrating bass that the buds 2 have. I lost my first pair to a compacter in the backrooms of a facility; but immediately bought another pair. I forgot to mention they stay in better than the Galaxy 2 Pro.,450,0.3002,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,449.6998
16,Very happy with the product until my own actions caused me to find out that the charging case is not as water resistant as the buds themselves. Take extra caution because mine took a spin in the washing machine and I am now purchasing a replacement case.,254,0.251,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,253.749
17,I??¶e been using these earbuds for a little while now; and they??¶e been great. The sound quality is clear with a nice balance of bass and treble; making music and podcasts really enjoyable. They fit comfortably in my ears without slipping; even during workouts; and they??±e lightweight enough that I can wear them for long periods without discomfort. The battery life is impressive; I can go days with regular use before needing a recharge. I also love how easy they are to connect to my phone with Bluetooth. For the price; these earbuds deliver excellent performance and convenience.,584,0.3761,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,584.3761
18,Earbuds are pretty good and you won't feel (terribly) remorseful about spending the $$$to get them. The buds worked seamlessly with my Samsung phone and connected instantaneously right out of the box. Fit and feel were great. I loved the feel and shape of the case - slim; sleek; and no bulk in my pockets. I did return the earbuds to Amazon because the silicone tip completelu ripped from the base when I tried to swap tip sizes. Strange design. I followed the directions and watched the instructional vid; but it still ripped. Disappointing. Hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. Otherwise; pretty dang good.,604,0.3559,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,604.3559
19,These pair up excellent with my Samsung phone. Great built quality and comfort. They stay in your ear very well and they have a lot of options. Noise cancellation if fantastic. Ear support works well for me I can use them for long period of time without bothering me. Clarity of the sound makes these optimal for those that like clear sound quality. Some of the touch control options have a bit of getting use to. You also get to hear language translation during a face to face conversation so you don't have to worry about not speaking a different language. Overall I do like and enjoy them and also comes with 2 year warranty.,628,0.3329,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,628.3329
20,Sound pretty good bass is good enough not the best though there ok there really good for fe versions.. the price is also good. They have more controls and easier to control. The case is a 10 out of 10; I had recently had the beats studio buds plus. And the noise canceling and sound quality and case is worse everything is better on these the case of these galaxy earbuds is fantastic it doenst feel cheap has a nice snap shut. Its really good the controls are responsive and they fit great and sound great. Nice accessibility controls.,536,0.3072,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,536.3072
21,Noise cancellation not as expected. I hear a hissing sound as compared to no ANC mode.,86,0.1648,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,85.8352
22,Sounds great; needed to order foam tips to create a perfect fit. Touch controls are a bit cumbersome; but my watch can control everything so no big deal for me,159,0.167,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,158.833
23,Definitely a good set of earbuds. The case is small and fits well in your pocket. Comes with 4 different sizes for the buds tip so you can pick the one that fits you best. Range is pretty good. I can leave my phone in the kitchen and use them through out the house with out them cutting out. Wireless charging is what you'd expect but on one charge you can recharge the buds all day no problem. I did have an issue where the earbuds weren't charging so samsung replaced them all together. One of my favorite features of Samsung is the ability to use only one bud at a time swapping when they die. I drive for work so instead of buying a $200+ headset id much prefer these. Definitely recommend getting a protective shell because the aluminum on the case scratches super easy.,775,0.3017,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,775.3017
24,While I still prefer the previous generation of galaxy buds; I do enjoy this generation. The stem is awkward for me; but the fit and feel is fine. My only real complaint is depending on what I'm doing they might fall out of my ears. Never had an issue with connectivity or sound quality and it's what I expect from Samsung. I got myself the white ones and my husband the black/grey ones because that's our personal preference. I love my white ones.,448,0.2819,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,447.7181
25,I debated for awhile to upgrade from the buds 2 if it was worth it but after one of the buds stopped holding a charge I pulled the trigger and wow what an improvement in sound over buds 2! I???glad I upgraded well worth it,222,0.2797,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,221.7203
26,The volume is great The plug into your ears are great. The case is small. You can hold it in your hand. The range is excellent.,127,0.2469,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,126.7531
27,Awesome earbuds. I use the constantly everyday at work and home. Typical charge lasts from 8am to about 4pm using ambient sound setting. Charges fairly quick. Sounds is great. Noise cancelation works fairly well also. Only complaint is sometimes the left ear buddy doesn't want to charge at times,296,0.2968,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,295.7032
28,They are just perfect; still not great sound as airpods pro 3 but it is the smartest and comfiest Airbuds ever! it has really good touch sensors and really sensible volume controls; but if you missclick you may end call or end meeting(like i did). in conclusion if you want smart and durable but little bit less sound quality; just buy it!,339,0.3592,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,338.6408

33,Ordered these for my boyfriend for his birthday! Loves them. Battery has a long life; they function properly; says they are very comfortable & even comes with different ear pieces to fit your specific ear type; sounds amazing as well as noise canceling!,253,0.3376,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,252.6624

35,Improvements from the 2s. Solid Noice cancelation. Able to get for $180 so more worth it then the original $249.99 price tag.,125,0.164,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,124.836
36,Great sound if you have a Samsung phone. Don't recommend for working out though they fall out.,94,0.2847,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,93.7153
37,Good or bad first. So far my only complaint is the way they come from your head to the box. There's a 180 degree turn with is very unintuitive especially one handed since the surface is very slick. Other samsung ear buds (I've had one of each) you pull them out and pop them in. Not these. The speaker piece sits in the box opposite as it does in your head. Annoying enough to lose a star. Now the good. The sound quality. I have never; and I'm not paid or a bot; have never had headphones that sound this good. You are IN the music if that makes sense. Like you are the audio engineer. I can hear things in my favorite songs I've listened to for 20 years and never knew it was there. And I dont mean modern songs. I mean something as aggressive as slipknot recorded in 2004 when hifi was top of the line. Like when cd quality recordings sounded new but are trash now. No these will take you back to the moment that track was mixed. The price is steep for something that will likely fall out of your pocket but if your ears are going bad like mine...these will take that away for you. Atleast with songs. I honestly choked when I first used these.,1147,0.3313,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,1147.3313
38,I have had a few ear buds but for this one I was looking for something that balances music quality and talking feature that gave a more clear sound. These buds are great overall just when talking to people in a public place the buds don't work as good as just using the phone itself which is alitte disappointing but they fair better than most other products I have used in a busy setting,388,0.2918,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,387.7082
39,I daily drive a Samsung Ultra 23 phone and have owned the Galaxy pro buds 2; Airpods OG & Pros; and most recently Beats Stuido buds Pro. These headphones are the most comfortable I've experienced for my picky ears. I work in a factory and have at least one in for more than half of a 8 hour shift. The battery on each buds gets me through around 4 hours at 60% volume while periodically enabling pass through to hear coworkers. This pass through mode is fantastic for my hard of earning; tho I've had a feedback issue show more than once resulting in a high pitch squealing sound that is fixed but disabling pass through. This issue feels like interference or an intense increase of noise in your surroundings. Bass is great when the buds are fully seated and dual bud use is almost an complete escape from the factory floor noise. Audio is clear; loud; and with the high quality sound option enabled fantastic ( audio lag in videos is very noticeable with this option on; but also has a warning of this lag below the enbale option). My IPhone using partner who daily drives her Airpod pros didn't notice a difference in the high quality setting. I gave them 5 stars due to sound; battery life; but mostly due to the comfort and pass through mode clarity. A non rounded review would be 4.7 stars because of the mic being very tin-y but better than the beats studio pros. These headphones come the closest to the magic I felt when putting in the Airpod pros. I can not understate the comfort. Charging is quick. Pros-Comfortable as heck; better in ear fit than the pro buds 2 & air pods pros. Microphone for calls & discord is tin-y but can be understood in a factory setting through a beanie. Noise canceling is ok near airport pros but definitely better pass through. Fantastic sound; magnetic case with flat top and bottom which is the weirdest thing to explain how great it is. Cons- battery per bud is shorter than pro buds 2 in my use case. The Find my feature requires a janky setup that feels like they still can learn from apple. Pass through sometimes squeals if certain conditions are meet but feels more like a my job issue than a bug.,2146,0.2865,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,2146.2865
40,These are great for me! Perfect sound! Love the sound canceling function. Not sure why all reviews aren't awesome. Some people mentioning a loud beep...I did hear a beep once or twice when they were touching and I was holding them together. But that is not a normal or frequent situation. I have no regrets buying this item! Love them!,335,0.3055,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,334.6945
41,I had their older model and it was way better; this one doesn't fit well. And the battery doesn't last as long,110,0.1555,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,109.8445

44,I like the sound quality for the Buds 3 Pro; and the noise cancellation is great. I don't find them as comfortable as my Galaxy Buds 2; but that varies person to person.

48,I had been wanting a set of these earbuds for a long time. They had some amazing sounding features. I began going to the gym frequently and thought these would be just the thing with the voice commands. From the very beginning I had problems with fit. I never really got a positive response to the software test of the fit of the buds. I swapped out all three of the rubber tips for the buds in hope I could get the software test to give me a good fit report. It was not to be. Sometimes I would get a good fit on one of the buds and the very next test would show a poor fit again. I tried every different configuration and combination of tips; but nothing resulted in a 'good fit'. I tried them a few times while walking the inside track and listened to music. The voice commands were good; but the sound quality never really did the job. I went thru all of the options in the 'Wear' app to fine tune the quality. My old wired headset blocked out far more of the outside noise than these expensive buds. Some of the suggestions I researched on line recommended to buy the soft ear canal tips from a 3rd party. Why didn't Samsung design their product to work in the first place. I have been a Samsung user for decades; but this was a great disappointment.,1255,0.3433,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,1255.3433
49,This earphones is magical. It's so small yet blocks noise so well. I wear it all the time sometimes just to give myself a quiet environment.,140,0.2927,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,139.7073
50,I don't have any technical experience with any of this stuff all I'm going to say is I had the Galaxy buds pro 2 and they were hit or miss the volume would literally shut off or lower on me every few seconds which was extremely annoying. These are amazing don't have that issue I mentioned above I love the feel of them I love the design,337,0.3126,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,336.6874
51,sound quality is excellent with these. however i had issues with them staying in my ears. i tried all of the sizes that came with to find the right fit and they would just randomly fall out and made my ear sore sometimes.

54,Just got these headphones 2 days ago cause I lost the case for my Bud 2 FEs. Honestly. Night and Day difference. It's like the sound quality for all my music lvl'ed up. It's gonna take a while for me to get used to good noise cancelling. Cause I when I take them off. I feel like my ears have to readjust the same way my eyes have to readjust whenever I game at 30fps then switch to a game running at 60fps+.

60,I bought the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro as a birthday gift for my mom and she absolutely loved them! The sound quality is amazing; and the noise cancellation and the mic quality really impressed her. They paired instantly with her phone and the touch controls are super easy to use. She says they??±e really comfortable and the battery lasts a long time. Totally worth it?ë´«ade her birthday extra special!,402,0.3243,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,401.6757
61,I've been an avid samsung only guy since the early galaxy s4 etc to include the 1st buds. This ain't that. Let me explain. 1st the bud part the part that sticks in your ear is odd shaped. 2nd the inserts included are trash ?ë¿? absolutely trash. Read the reviews. Everyone recommends from the day u open these to buy the foamy ones. So another 30 on top of the already  pricey buds. 3rd even with the new foams the fit for me and my ears is fair at best. Aside from the bad above; they are awesome like every other bud before. Not gonna give them less than a 3 because the sound quality in perfect fitment is amazing. The slide volume feature alot of good but it takes some getting used to at least for me. Im well over a month and still I struggle to get the right bud inserts and perfect fit.,793,0.3092,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,793.3092
62,People have called me a bit of an audiophile snob; and its true ive owned everuthing from a few dollar included apple earbuds; to $4;500 flagship LCD-5 headphones from esteemed acoustic engineering company Audeze (their mm-500 was the step down model that Kendrick Lamar used to master a recent album). All that is to say that these are perfect; and I know what I am talking about. The shape makes them very easy to use; and extremely comfortable for long periods of time. The sound is good enough that I dont care; and the features like the lights add genuine value. Sure; they could have made the earbuds easier to get into the case; or included spinfit eartips (the best eartip upgrade to any iem); but its so good that I finally dont care about bluetooth earbuds anymore.,775,0.3521,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,775.3521

Still an error. They must sit out on the counter for hours until somehow they are magically dry. This is INCREDIBLY annoying; effectively ruining my experience with an otherwise good product. This never happens with airpods. Didn't happen with my old Galaxy Buds. Customer support was not helpful.

82,Let's face it; if you have an Android phone; these are basically AirPods Pro. I bought them as an upgrade to my Galaxy Buds FE. Here's the rub: they have very good sound and the noise canceling is excellent; but it's entirely let down by the design. Putting the earbuds in backwards is just stupid. Also; the triangular shape of the stem is sharp and makes wind so loud through the ANC; which doesn't automatically turn itself down to compensate like my Buds FE do. They have random glitches; too... A lot.,506,0.3358,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,506.3358
83,Much better than I expected and I think part of that has to do with 2 drivers (speakers) per earbud. My go to buds had been the NuraTrue Pro which is now Denon and I still use them. Both have a unique clarity in their own way but are not too much different overall. Buds 3 Pro might just have a little more clarity and bass due to the fact of 2 drivers. Would definitely recommend them; especially since the price has dropped. Like any other electronic device; and there are plenty; it comes down to personal preference and of course; price. They are very light in your ears and to me are comfortable for quite a while.,619,0.2899,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,619.2899
84,Noise cancellation not as expected. I hear a hissing sound as compared to no ANC mode.,86,0.1648,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,85.8352
85,If you go to the gym or do exercise in any capacity; these will slip out of your ears; and then the case will proceed to not charge the earbuds; I'd give these negative stars if i could,185,0.2482,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,184.7518

87,The ear buds themselves are great; but I ordered 2 of these and both had issues straight out of the box with the case refusing to charge; red flashing light indicating some kind of error.

88,The galaxy buds3 pro are an extremely disappointing product. While I'm going to give credit where credit is due; all of its strengths crumble under the weight of wanting to be Apple. They had perfected the compact earbud design with the buds2 pro; but decided to go with an awful stem design instead of sticking to what made them great. The new design makes these one of the most uncomfortable earbuds in the market; which is why I returned them and I'm going back to my buds2 pro.,481,0.3031,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,480.6969
89,Pros: 1. Great IP rating for heavy workouts even under the rain. 2. Amazing sound signature with a V shaped tuning that makes them sound very lively and full. The dual driver design allows it to punch way above its weight by having different drivers handle bass and treble/mids. 3. Noise cancelling is solid. Not the best; but very usable. Transparency mode is good. You can hear yourself while in calls and have conversations when wearing them. Love that you can have transparency on when wearing just one bud. 4. Support for high quality codecs; especially when paired with Samsung phones; makes music and movies sound great.,627,0.2263,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,1,627.2263

94,These are solid earbuds. I mow lawns for a living so noise cancelling is a must. On a mower it's pretty good but weed eating it lets some noise through. The call quality is super good; I can talk on the phone with a mower at almost full throttle and my voice carries through. The fit is okay; but I've had better. But overall a great buy.,338,0.2979,earbuds,Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI Tr,0,337.7021
95,I was really excited to try the Samsung Buds 3 Pro; but my experience has been nothing short of frustrating. The earbuds won???charge properly at all. Every time I put them in the case; I just get a constant red blinking light and no actual charging. I??¶e tried different cables; chargers; and even resetting them; but nothing works. For the price; I expected much better quality and reliability. It feels like a defective product right out of the box.

1,The Apple AirPods 3rd Generation exceeded my expectations! The sound is crisp and clear with great bass; and the spatial audio feature really enhances the listening experience. They fit comfortably in my ears for long periods without any discomfort; and the battery life is excellent?ë´ªasting all day with quick charging. The seamless connection with my Apple devices makes switching between them effortless. If you??±e looking for premium wireless earbuds with superb sound and convenience; these AirPods are definitely worth it. I???very happy with my purchase!,561,0.3061,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) ,1,561.3061

5,These ones hurt my ears physically. I guess my ears are too small. So if you don???have small ears then they should fit fine. I have sores on the ridges on my ears. Similar to getting new shoes and you have sores on your lower ankles. You have to break them in I guess? However the physical durability is outstanding! The bad news is they fell out of my case somehow. I don???know how that happened as they magnetically connect to close. Lost them at work. I was able to track them and they in the gutter. It must have happened when I was loading my car up to leave. Found the next day. They were ran over BUT they still work! They still charge and the mute buttons work. Amazing! Even though I can???use them because it???just too painful. The size/shape doesn???bother my teen. It still puzzles me how they got bumped out of the charging case and lost to begin with but thrilled it???not a total loss.,903,0.3155,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,903.3155

8,Got the Apple AirPods Gen 3 recently. I like the improved sound the spatial awareness surround sound feature is nice. I like that compared to the gen1; you can hear what is going on around you sound wise at the appropriate volumes. The bass is rich; highs are good. The controls work well; pods are well built of quality material. Connectivity is good and does drop audio. I will say the only thing that I have a problem with the fit of the AirPods. Unlike the gen 1 and 2 that just hangs well on my ears they???seem a little loose. When I smile I can feel them dislodging. The smaller size makes it hard to handle if you have bigger hands. While controls are responsive; depending on size of your hands it may be difficult to find the little indentation to control them. This model did not come with the wireless MagSafe charger case. Spend the extra $10 to get that feature. Definitely worth it. Looking back I would have gotten the AirPod pros 2 for a more secure fit. But that is just me.,992,0.314,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,992.314
9,First things first; I succumbed to Prime Day & couldn???pass up the deal on these AirPods. Especially since with my current AirPods starting to crap out. However; I???going to be giving this review from the perspective of going from the 2nd gen AirPod pros to the 3rd gen. And it seems like bit of a downgrade. Now; the 2nd gen pros have it all. The extra silicon tips; the noise cancellation & transparency; & the ability to wirelessly charge (the case). And I had them for a good long while (the longest I??¶e had any AirPod) & the right bud is just starting to crackle when I play any audio through it and the battery is starting to go bad. Overall; I was honestly a little disappointed with the 3rd gen. Granted; it???not a pro version so it???not going to come with the noise cancellation. But the lack of silicon tips for the buds was a little surprising. I have trouble with any earbud staying in my left ear especially; & I??¶e used the 3rd gen during a few workouts so far & they??±e staying pretty well. But; they still feel just a little off & I ended up buying silicon tips to put over the buds instead - those helped with a bit of noise cancellation and security in my ears. But to go from the 2nd gen pros to the 3rd gen feels like I???losing a lot when it comes to function & capabilities. Now; if you??±e buying a pair of AirPods for the first time & just need the basics - then the 3rd gen is great. The bass sounds really good; overall sound quality is there & the buds without the silicon tips really aren???that bad. If you??±e used to that though; it???going to take a bit to adjust with the 3rd gen. But; like I did; there are silicon tips you can get to put over the buds to help.,1698,0.2995,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,1698.2995
10,The Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) have been a fantastic upgrade to my everyday audio experience. The personalized spatial audio is the standout feature?ë´§t creates an immersive listening environment; whether I???enjoying music; podcasts; or taking calls. The sound quality is crisp and well-balanced; with just the right amount of bass; and the adaptive EQ adjusts perfectly to whatever I???listening to. Comfort is another highlight. The earbuds have a lightweight; ergonomic design that fits securely without feeling intrusive; even during long listening sessions or workouts. They??±e also sweat and water-resistant; which gives me peace of mind when I???exercising or caught in the rain. The battery life is excellent; the earbuds last about six hours on a single charge; and the Lightning charging case extends it to an impressive 30 hours. While I???happy with the overall experience; I do miss the silicone ear tips from the AirPods Pro for added noise isolation. These don???have active noise cancellation; so they??±e not ideal in very noisy environments. Also; they work best within the Apple ecosystem; so Android users might not get the full feature set. Overall; the 3rd Gen AirPods are a great choice for Apple users seeking high-quality wireless earbuds with excellent sound; comfort; and battery life. They strike a good balance between premium features and ease of use; making them a worthwhile investment.,1421,0.3382,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,1421.3382

18,This is my 3rd pair. My dog ate my AirPods; it was nighttime; and I had them around my neck on a lanyard with it; laying on the other side of my body. How she opened the case up and got the earbuds out and ATM I will never know.. anyway I found them one on the couch and one in the floor somewhere. I picked it up and dangled at her and she took off running. She knew she was in deep Doodoo. But I???very very pleased with this pair. It seems like a repair I buy they just get better. This fit the GEN three is even better for my ears and the G2 was. I couldn???recommend highly enough for anyone who is a connoisseur of music like I am. They are wonderful. The base is wonderful. The sounds like you??±e just right there; I would highly recommend these for anyone even with small ears,784,0.325,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,784.325

23,These fit great in my ears and the sound quality is really nice. But for the price; I???hope for more features like noise canceling or audio transparency. They??±e pretty limited compared to the pros; but not having to use silicone tips is a huge plus. They stay in the ear and don???fall out nearly as often. Very comfortable too. Can have them in all day and they don???hurt my ear. The Find My feature works really well if you ever misplace one or the case. It can be a real lifesaver. However; you can???use them for the new hearing test feature unlike the pro model. I have both. Consider buying these if you need a pair of ear buds for use while exercising or on the go.,675,0.3155,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,675.3155
24,Delighted with this product I recommend,39,0.1748,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,38.8252
25,I purchased these the intention of using them with my iPhone 15 Pro. I have to say that I??¶e never been able to keep the ear phones supplied with any of my Apple products in my ears. These AirPods proved to be an expensive mistake. The sound quality is not just superb. It???fabulous; but that???of no use when you can???wear them in your ears they simply fall out immediately. I even purchased a little device that attaches to them in case they fall out of your ears or I should say when they fall out of your ears so that they don???get lost in an airlines seat . Unfortunately; if I keep fussing with them; I can push them into my ears twist them in various directions and they may stay for 10 or 15 seconds. As much as I would like to keep them because the spatial sound feature is unbelievably great they are useless because they won???allow me to keep them in my ! I mentioned earlier that I am an Apple stockholder. It???a great concern to me that Apple makes products that sell. I don???want my stock to lose value; but if they make ear phones that won???stay in somebody???head; then those sales are gonna plummet and if they plummet; they won???make Apple any money and my stock will be worthless.i intend to write Tim Cook and complain about thesw. Yes; i know some folks can wear them; but EVERYONE should be able to. Now; to add insult to injury; I find I am not able to return them as my trip to Europe exceeded the return window.,1444,0.3049,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,1444.3049

33,These work great but aren???as loved as the generation 2 AirPods. They work well; have held up for months with no issues; connect to iPhone with no problem; and are worth the money. They seem to be made well. However; they??±e a little wider than the generation 2 AirPods. Because of this; they sometimes want to come out of my ears. I didn???have this problem with my previous AirPods. Overall; these are great but I prefer generation 2 AirPods.,445,0.308,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,444.692

I even made an appointment at the genius bar being the genius that I am to learn that they are not broken; but did not include wireless charging. Wow; I didn???even know that was the thing! so I started getting angry; then the nice young lady at the Apple Store asked me if I had an old pair which I said of course I do. She said put those AirPods in the charging case.! Voila!! Now I have brand new AirPods for an old charging case that wirelessly charges for less than the price of two new AirPods.

40,Not too long ago; I got the fourth generation AirPods. Until I got those these third gens were my favorite. Honestly; they??±e still amazing headphones. If you don???need or want active noise canceling then there???no reason to get anything other than these. I hate silicone tip earbuds so I??¶e always gone with the AirPod line. The sound quality is great. If you have other Apple devices; the connectivity is amazing. I really had no complaints about the AirPods three. The main reason I got the AirPod four was because of noise cancellation.,542,0.3017,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,542.3017
41,I noticed that it became harder to hear the music at a personal level; even though the sound seemed louder to others around me. While they were fantastic to begin with; the performance started to degrade after a while. If you??±e looking for solid earbuds to begin with; they??±e worth considering.,296,0.3053,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,295.6947

43,These are not fakes they are legit and worth every cent for people that like to listen to music but it has a lot more features little features like taking calls ;watching videos ;tapping on them ;sensing your ears for when you put in and on ; and so much more I???still learning. when you put them on they have a special design that makes that???comfortable and can fit in anyone???ear. Also when there in your ear there super light. The sound quality is way more than I need and has spatial audio that makes every sound feel like it???coming from your room and not your AirPods. To enable it you have to hold on the sound button on your phone or go to the settings. And if you lost them you can track them with Find My. Overall I give it 5 stars. Theses have every thing you need. Would get these if this is your first time buying AirPods.,840,0.2962,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,840.2962

46,Water proof. It fell in a bucket of paint and it's still working,64,0.0336,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,63.9664
47,The Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) have quickly become my go-to wireless earbuds; offering a fantastic blend of immersive sound quality; comfort; and convenience. The personalized spatial audio feature is a standout; creating an immersive listening experience that makes music and podcasts feel more engaging. The sound is crisp and well-balanced; with impressive bass that doesn???overpower the mids and highs. One of the best aspects is the comfort. The redesigned shape fits snugly in my ears; and I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. They??±e also sweat and water resistant; which is perfect for my workouts and outdoor activities. I don???have to worry about them getting damaged by a bit of moisture; making them a reliable choice for various situations. However; there are a few things to consider. While the sound quality is excellent; audiophiles might find it lacking compared to high-end; over-ear headphones. Additionally; the price is on the higher side; which might be a concern for those looking for more budget-friendly options. Ohhh my bagggezus!!!! I??¶e had two pairs of style of beats and the old school apple buds; but these!!!!! It???3D for your ear pleasure!!!!!!! These beat the beats; by millions. Don???waste 350$ on beats. Get these!!,1272,0.3008,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,1272.3008
48,I got these to replace my original AirPods 1st gen. The ear buds seem larger than the 1st gen ear buds; and I had a little trouble getting them to stay in my ears. If you have small ears; you are going to have a lot of trouble getting them to stay in. I haven't had a lot of time to test them out as they came with very little charge. They did pair easily and quickly with both my iPhone 15 and my iPad Air 11 inch (M2). The sound quality was good on the one song I listened to to test them out. Hopefully the battery life is longer than my 1st gen AirPods (which were only lasting about 20 minutes at the end).,611,0.3202,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,611.3202
49,Came brand new; both AirPods work. Needed a new pair because my left AirPod; from my old pair; fell in the sink :( but bought these and so far so good! Easy to connect; came with a charger as well! Earbuds are very loud! Design is always top tier; thankssss again!,264,0.2548,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,263.7452
50,Down grade if your coming from the AirPod pro gen 2 I would suggest sticking with gen 2 rather than gen 3. They are uncomfortable in ear. Don???stay in ear as well as gen 2 with the rubber tips. The quality also feels kinda cheap. Apple missed the mark with these,263,0.2785,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,262.7215
51,I bought these to use as I drive and travel..... I though they would eliminate the road noise and walking through the airport.. However Too many settings- these I thought I would love but the number of settings made it hard to use them for conversations; half the time the other people could not hear me... its like it blocked too much out and with so many settings it was like setting up an airplane trying all the options... if I had them connected to my iPad and my phone I was constantly adjusting the settings to hear the other person and them to hear me. I went back to using the old ones as they are just way easier to use. The older version of course has a longer battery life as there is no cancelling and way less electronics going on... the Mic was a problem; had to basically turn off all the fancy settings to use them for any phone conversations.,860,0.255,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),1,860.255

I have one with a video playing and one with a game running; and the user experience was not good.,325,0.346,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,324.654
59,I bought them and wore them for a day. They sound awesome but they didn't fit my ears. They kept falling out. I decided to send them back the next day to get the next generation. The only way to return them was through Amazon picking them up from my home through UPS. Then when they picked them up I didn't get my money back right away. I'm being told I won't get my money back for about 30 days. $182.00 that I won't be able to see for 30 days. That's if they send it at all.

67,I do a lot of grinding and welding with these on. The metal dust clings to the case and slowly makes its way inside the air pods themselves every time. This is my first set of 3rd generation; I??¶e had 4 pairs of 1st generation air pods and they really don???last much longer than a year; but I use apple care till I can???then just retire them to my desk drawer with the rest. After this Im just going to stick with the 1st gen version because they are cheaper and seem to stay in my ears better.,496,0.2053,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,495.7947

72,I bought these airpods and they work really well. They're cheaper than the noise cancellation second generation. The noise cancellation doesnt work as well as the second gen; but it doesnt really matter. Anyways I like it and it has wireless charging. Its also cheaper to buy it on here than the apple store,307,0.2754,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,306.7246
73,These have great battery life and the music quality is amazing. However; they do feel a little harsh on the ears unlike the first AirPods so I would probably recommend going for the newer ones with noise cancellation as I have also seen many people face the same issue with fitting.,282,0.344,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,281.656

78,My job got us all a pair of these as a team giveaway. I love these and the sound is really great. My only complaint is they don't have all the same shortcuts that could be done on the original pair. You can just do the very basics; you can't even turn up/down your volume. You can even long press them to activate Siri. Seems like a little bit of an oversight.,360,0.2899,earbuds,Apple AirPods (3rd Generation),0,359.7101

98,These ones hurt my ears physically. I guess my ears are too small. So if you don???have small ears then they should fit fine. I have sores on the ridges on my ears. Similar to getting new shoes and you have sores on your lower ankles. You have to break them in I guess? However the physical durability is outstanding! The bad news is they fell out of my case somehow. I don???know how that happened as they magnetically connect to close. Lost them at work. I was able to track them and they in the gutter. It must have happened when I was loading my car up to leave. Found the next day. They were ran over BUT they still work! They still charge and the mute buttons work. Amazing! Even though I can???use them because it???just too painful. The size/shape doesn???bother my teen. It still puzzles me how they got bumped out of the charging case and lost to begin with but thrilled it???not a total loss.,903,0.3155,earbuds,Apple AirPods (100rd Generation),1,903.3155

1,I?»bought these after being a Jabra fan for years; but for a cheaper price these things are objectively better than my old pair of pretty nice Jabra Elites. The sound quality and noise cancellation are incredible - no need to blast the volume to feel like you??±e immersed in the sound. Even at a low volume I can???hear anything else. I???very particular about the feel and fit of earbuds and these are comfortable and fit well right out the box. I do wish they fit a bit more flush (they stick out a lot imo); but that is purely aesthetic and has no bearing on the performance of the earphones. They are overall very comfortable for extended wear and use. I haven???fully tested the battery life yet but I like that they tell you the battery % when you first put them on; and that the case charges wirelessly as well as plugged in. The voice controls are great; but the earphones themselves are pretty touch sensitive so that is something to adjust to. Overall I am very glad I gave these Bose Quiet Comfort earphones a shot. If you??±e looking for stellar sound quality without paying exorbitant price then I highly recommend this product.,1139,0.3416,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,1139.3416
2,I am very happy with these headphones; especially with the sale price from Prime Day! They have excellent noise cancelling ability and have very clear sound quality. The purple is a nice light color that I really like; and is what I expected from product images. They are also great for travel and portability since they are so much smaller than standard; over-ear headphones. They are comfortable to wear for a couple of hours or so; but they do start to get a little sore after prolonged wear in my smaller sized ears. I was worried they would not fit in my ear/stay in my ear; but so far I haven't had any issues with them falling out! I will say that if I have to adjust them in my ear; I tend to accidentally trigger a 'pause' but that's not a huge deal to me as it's easy to just tap it again and restart the audio. Overall I'm really happy with these and would buy them again but probably would not use them exclusively and would alternate them with over-ear headphones for comfort on long days of listening,1014,0.3341,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,1014.3341
3,I owned the first QC earbuds for about 3 years and worked great. The QC2 price was reasonable and cost less than the QC1 earbuds did when i bought them. I upgraded to the QC2 earbuds and were good for a few days. They have multipoint connectivity that worked great; and the sound quality is amazing that Bose is known for. The app was awesome for custom EQ settings although had limited controls. They were fairly comfortable but would become a little irritating after a couple hours of use and always needed some readjustment. Then the earbuds would randomly disconnect from a device or; if connected to two devices; would decide to connect to the other device not being used for no reason and i would have to go into settings to reconnect to whatever was being used. After a week or so i did a product swap assuming i had a faulty pair; but after a day or so the new pair did the same. I returned them and went with the Technics earbuds at a higher price but much better quality.,981,0.2984,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,981.2984
4,The fit is ok. The noise reduction is incredible! The sound is great. But the charging indicator absolutely sucks! I've only had them a few months and numerous times I've put them in my ears only to find they're dead. The indicator was 'orange' but it wasn't enough to charge the earphones. I've got $40 earphones with much better charge indicators. I've basically had to plug the damn things in any time the indicator isn't green. Fix that and they would be outstanding!,471,0.2753,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,470.7247
5,I got the white pair. The first pair was defective and it just kept beeping right out of the box and I couldnt pair. Got a replacement and after having them for over a month. I can say that these are great earbuds. They hold well and are really comfortable. I have the kind of ears that have every earbud falling out but these dont. Noise canceling is really good and ive even dropped them a few times and they are still holding up well. Excellent sound quality.,462,0.3181,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,461.6819
6,Very good pair of ear buds. Had a pair of Beats studio ear buds and compared to those; these blow them out of the water. The anc is superb. On my break at work; I had some coworkers walk into the break room and didn't even hear them coming. I only heard them talking and just barely at all. The sound from these buds is great; too. Initially I thought the bass was weak; but after using the bass boost eq in the app; it's real nice. The app also has other eq presets with the option to set your own preset. My only issues with these ear buds is that the charging case is kinda bulky and the ear buds have to be in ear or have something pressing against the sensor or it'll interrupt whatever you're listening to. Other than that; it's a solid very much worth the asking price.,776,0.3352,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,776.3352
7,Way over priced and the price has been going down so if you want them you can wait. I've tried ever attachment size and if I lean over to pick something up they still have a tendency to fall out; especially if I'm wearing them for a while; the also fall out sometimes and unless they make a noise fall on the ground; I don't feel and fall out of here. There's a lot of bitches trying to connect it to the app so I wasn't able to register the device in time before I already lost an earbud. One I can't for the wife. I can't figure out why Bose has multiple apps to manage it's different devices. That makes no sense for long-term loyal customers. Could you imagine having to go into Google lights and then going into Google home to manage the rest of your devices? For me it has been a huge waste of money. This is my fifth Bose purchase and I've only really loved 1 of 5. I think this might be my last considering their price point. All that said; the sound is great. The aware; and quit settings are great. They also do have a great battery life. I thought if I bought Bose I would finally have a pair of buds that worked well for me but... All in all; I just miss my Google bud a model; best fit so far; decent sound; no bells and whistles.... But remember the most important thing you need when you buy earbuds is for them to stay in.,1338,0.3124,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,1338.3124
8,I had some old Bose QC earbuds with the wing tips and was upset when they quit making those. But these stay in; even during heavy workouts. The old app wasn???bad and the new app kinda sucks. But otherwise; these are great and the noise cancelling is top notch.,261,0.3157,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,260.6843
9,Genuinely a great product that I recommend. This is at an approachable price point for new audiophiles. BUT; it can be a tiny bit buggy. Make SURE you download the app because maybe once a month you coukd have a connection issue. If the bluetooth connectivity acts up; put them back in the case; close the case; wait a few seconds and try again.,345,0.2572,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,344.7428
10,I've had these for a few weeks now and they've been great so far. They are way more comfortable than the version I bought a few years ago that I replaced with these because they finally started giving out. The app was great for configuring the touch options the way I like; and I don't know what that reviewer that said the noise cancelling was no good was talking about. Either they were reviewing the wrong product or they got a faulty one; but the quiet mode is legit; the ambient mode still has clarity of sound while allowing me to hear my surroundings; and the 'off' mode is a decent balance of both.,606,0.3219,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,606.3219
11,These are really good! The noise cancelation works super good! These earbuds have an equalizer where you can adjust the bass and treble thru the app. The sound is super crisp and smooth. I was hesitant to get these or airpod pros but these are the win! The only thing i can mention; is the fit sometimes bugs the ears after a long time of use; it doesn???bug me because this happens regardless of the earbuds.,409,0.3564,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,408.6436
12,I am in Love with my Bose earbuds!! Purchased them in May this year. Thought I lost them today and let me tell you I was crying. My husband let me order another pair same color and all but we found them. Listening to music is the best with these earbuds and I even listen to audio books as well. Bose has always been my go to for earbuds as this is my 3rd pair owning. The noise canceling is amazing; my husband watches TV super loud but I can't hear the TV with them on and can enjoy my music without having to tell him to turn down the TV. Even when people are talking you can't hear them. You can always tap your earbud and it turns off the noise canceling. It goes for hours and hours charged so I can listen to my music all day while I clean my house or I can be on the phone talking with my sister all day!! One day soon I will be buying a pair for my sister. I will always buy Bose earbuds; best speaker for music it's amazing. I hope I have these earbuds for many; many years! I also love how the case fits right in my hand!! Now if I can figure out how to remember where I set my earbud case at so I don't panic .... I never want to lose them!!,1153,0.31,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,1153.31
13,The headphones sound like 10; I really recommend them a lot. The only bad thing was that they came to me without a rubber band; it has spare parts but the original size had no replacement.,188,0.2479,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,187.7521
14,Great product for the price. Not as noise canceling as some of their other products.,84,0.2886,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,83.7114
15,My only problem is you don't know when you need to charge the case because it does not show like other brands.,110,0.1328,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,109.8672
16,Got them and tried them out and was really super impressed! The bass is amazing and treble is as well. Just all around great sound quality and fit in the ear easy and feel so light like there isn???anything in your ear. The noise cancellation is amazing as well. Everything this advertises I lives up to and more. I love them and will be sticking with Bose in the future.,371,0.3484,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,370.6516
17,Works great for music and listening to things but not for talking,65,0.2079,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,64.7921
18,Overall I really like these. They are comfortable and the sound quality is good. My one complaint is that it automatically shuts off after a certain amount of time to save battery and there is no way to adjust it. I wear one at night to fight tinnitus; so when it turns off; I often wake up. If Bose would just add the ability to control this feature in the app then it wouldn???be a problem.,392,0.3434,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,391.6566
19,They seem like a really great product and all the features that I tried Work as they should; however; if you have an iPhone and are used to using Apple AirPods with the ease of seamless pairing and functionality; you may be disappointed with these as there were a couple issues when pairing. or example; every time I compare them to my phone it is a process that you have to open the app and click connect and then half the time it doesn???work right and you have to refresh the app. Additionally; when they do connect correctly; after opening the app and pushing the connect button; for some reason; they change your ringer volume to about 75% which for me is way louder than I normally have it. Although once they are connected and playing music; adjusting the volume changes the media volume like it should for some reason when they initially connect; they always Raise my ringer volume on my iPhone. It???possible this is a setting that could be changed however; I didn???look into it much further because they are nothing like the plug-in play functionality that I have come to love with my Apple AirPods Pro..,1115,0.2681,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,1115.2681
20,These are the best ear buds I have owned throughout the years. I can have these in my ears for hours and not have any discomfort. No Bluetooth issues; really good noise cancelling for ear buds. I mainly listen to music; audiobooks; and podcasts; and I find the volume ranges really good. And they don't break the bank.,318,0.3558,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,317.6442
21,It works great for noise canceling when using power tools and comfortable for a 10 hour day being able to switch one of them out halfway through the day. The magnetic charging in the case however has gotten some steel dust in it and won???properly charge; I??¶e tried cleaning it multiple times with little success. Would recommend for anyone other than metal workers.,367,0.1831,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,366.8169
22,Bought these after i left my last pair of Bose earbuds on the bumper of my Jeep and accidentally took them for a ride. These earbuds are incredible. Nothing beats the Bose sound!! Plus these stay put in my ears and I never have to adjust them. I like that I can set up the touch controls on the Bose app and customize them to my liking. Well worth the money to me !!! 5 stars definitely,386,0.347,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,385.653
23,I love my Bose QuietComfot Bluetooth Earbuds! These earbuds have the best noise cancellation and great Bose sound. They fit comfortably in the ear and are easy to use. I love the way they snap in the case so you know they are secure and charging. The battery life is exceptional. I highly recommend these earbuds especially if you are looking for true noise cancellation and great quality sound.,395,0.3325,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,394.6675
24,I love the sound and fit of these; my only issue is the microphone. If you??±e not speaking at full volume then it struggles to pick up on what you??±e saying. The Bluetooth connectivity isn???really an issue for me. The app is easy to use. Other than the sound cutting out for less than half a second shortly after pairing; there???no issue with connectivity. You can configure the tap controls in the app so you choose which buttons perform which action. I???buy these over other headphones; and I think they??±e worth the money,527,0.3016,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,527.3016
25,For sound quality and noise cancellation that???an A plus but for fitting not too good because they keep falling out of my ears maybe my ears are too small. Anyway if you don???mind they??±e falling out then buy them because they??±e excellent products.,251,0.3165,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,250.6835
26,Love the sound and fit; but I was disappointed when traveling regarding the noise suppression.,94,0.2496,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,93.7504
27,If you??±e working in a noisy environment; Bose earplugs are an excellent choice for enhancing focus and comfort. The Active Noise Cancellation technology is top-tier; reducing ambient noise significantly and allowing you to concentrate better. The comfort level is generally good; though it might take some time to find the perfect fit. For those needing reliable noise reduction; comfort; and clear sound; Bose earplugs are a solid investmen,442,0.2516,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,441.7484
28,If i could give this a 4.5 star i would mainly docking it half a star for the cancellation issues and mic. Otherwise an outstanding set of ear buds able to compete with the best out now. Shopping for ANC earbuds have become more and more competitive and to stand out requires execution at the highest level. I found the bose quiet comforts to stand excellent in many of the categories most people will care about but lacking in some key hardware like the microphone keeping it from being the perfect set for most people. The earbuds are very easy to set up and if you download the accompanying app you will unlock many controls to tune the sound and hardware UI for this device. The ear buds themselves fit great into the ear and seal the canal and outter part of the ear giving you a great seal and generating a much better ANC quality than most other ear buds at this price range. Now if you are familiar with the tech the anc will take in sound and kind of counter it to create the ANC and for the most part the bose QC do a great job at that. the only issues is some cancellation sounds are audible and quite loud like to wind so i probably wouldnt recommend these for runners or walkers; but sitting in a office or plane these are perfect. Comfortwise is another highlight for these earbuds they will sit in your canal and a little on the outside but feel very weightless in the ear and even over extended periods will not trap too much heat. I barely noticed they were on when working out in a gym and really give immersion when the ANC is on. The control are very easy to use on the earbuds just tap and hold on them for different uses that can be controlled on the app and turned on and off if you dont want them. The battery life is also quite impressive as these are larger units i got quite a lot of run time with them usually in the range of 6-8 hours on listening to music which is quite amazing. Now for probably the biggest downfall of this pair is the microphone. The sound is very hollow and tinny with a lot of distortion. It is understandable to the other party but very artificial in quality giving you more of a robot tone. I wish the sound could be clearer and more natural but understandable for ear buds. It may be intereference from the ANC mic but man it is truly the weakest point of these otherwise amazing ear buds.,2344,0.2883,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,2344.2883
29,These buds are produced by bose; one of the most highly respected names in sound reproduction. They don't disappoint. They sound fabulous. Highest highs to lowest bass notes; they respond extremely well. I find them to be a little heavy and though not uncomfortable I have trouble keeping them in my ears. This is; I'm sure; due to the poorly engineered shape and size of my ears; more so than any product short coming. I have this problem with earbuds; even ones that don't sound this good. All in all... Highly Recommend.,523,0.3073,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,523.3073
30,These are truly nice earbuds - they fit comfortably (when I can get them in my ears just right) and transmit sound quite well. However; figuring out just how to position in them in my ears has been a challenge. Half the time they fall out; which disconnects whatever phone call I'm on. I'm hoping I eventually get the knack.,324,0.3055,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,323.6945
31,As someone who???always on the go; I recently got my hands on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds; and I couldn???wait to put them to the test. Here???my take on these highly praised earbuds. First impressions matter; and Bose doesn???disappoint. The QuietComfort Earbuds have a sleek; modern design that feels both premium and understated. They come with multiple ear tip sizes; ensuring a snug fit for everyone. I found them incredibly comfortable; even during extended listening sessions. The lightweight feel means I could wear them for hours without any discomfort. When it comes to sound; Bose is a brand that consistently delivers; and these earbuds are no exception. The audio quality is simply phenomenal. The soundstage is wide; with crisp highs; rich mids; and deep bass that doesn???overwhelm the other frequencies. Whether I was listening to classical music or the latest pop hits; every detail was clear and well-balanced. One of the standout features of the QuietComfort Earbuds is the active noise cancellation (ANC). Bose has mastered this technology; allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music without distractions. Whether I was on a crowded subway or working in a bustling cafì±? the ANC effectively muted background noise; making for a truly peaceful listening experience. Plus; the ??›ware Mode??is a great addition; allowing me to stay aware of my surroundings when needed. With up to 6 hours of battery life on a single charge and an additional 12 hours with the charging case; I was impressed by the longevity. I could easily get through a full day of use without worrying about recharging. Plus; a quick 15-minute charge gives you about 2 hours of playtime?ë´¯erfect for those busy days. Pairing the earbuds was a breeze; and they maintained a stable connection throughout my use. The touch controls are intuitive; allowing me to play/pause music; skip tracks; and take calls effortlessly. The built-in microphone performed well during calls; ensuring that I could communicate clearly without any interruptions. Overall; the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds exceeded my expectations in both performance and comfort. They are perfect for anyone looking to enjoy their music without compromise. Whether you??±e commuting; working out; or sim,2252,0.3231,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,2252.3231
32,Love the noise canceling feature. When sweating; the feel as if they could fall out my ear.,91,0.2641,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,90.7359
33,once you customize the buttons how YOU want to use them- these are amazing! so comfortable; insane NC; stays in during crazy workouts; long battery life; incredible sound quality. NEVER going back to apple. I use this with my iPhone and they do great. worth the investment in yourself and your comfort!,302,0.2713,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,301.7287
34,First let me say I have purchased plenty of earbuds and do massive research ?ëµ?before I give my opinion; save the time on all the above and purchase these earbuds; I promise you will not regret; the fit and comfort is outstanding; the sound quality is amazing; the noise cancellation is superb! Buy once; cry once! Just buy them!!!,331,0.3557,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,330.6443
35,All was fine ..It's just i ordered Black and I got them turquoise,65,0.1366,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,64.8634
36,Love them! Great sound!,23,0.2836,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,22.7164
37,I found this one???very good. The fit; the sound and the noise canceling are quite good. Also the price; I don???know about the upgrade on the ultra ones; but for me this ones worth every dollar.,195,0.2567,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,194.7433
38,Go for them; you won???regret it.,33,0.0908,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,32.9092
39,it hits all the nice marks for sound quality; noise canceling; definitely comfort/fit/feel...but the ear detection is not something I could turn off which meant my music paused if it didn't sit just right in my ear. kind of annoying so I'm returning but its a nice product for the price. the other reviews are definitely on point,329,0.2517,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,328.7483
40,Great Sound! Fits great in the ear. Has an app to control things. Which is huge. The price was reasonable and affordable for great quality sound. Bose has always made great things.,180,0.3102,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,179.6898
41,The audio quality is truly impressive. I??¶e been using the Jabra Elite 7 for five years now; and while the Bose sounds better; I???take my Jabrea???over these. There have been instances of interference issues that cause the music to break up. The case lacks sufficient power to charge both earbuds; and it???quite large. Despite these drawbacks; the value is reasonable. However; I would appreciate the ability to adjust the quiet and aware modes. Furthermore; the sound quality is great but is externally sensitive. These earbuds are extremely loud; you can hear the speaker maxing out. Once you get used to the rubber pieces; they are quite comfortable.,655,0.2985,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,655.2985
42,Counting these; I??¶e had the last 3 generations of this product. In my opinion; the first generation was the best. The removable earpieces seemed to protrude more and put more pressure against your ear; but they also felt more secure and didn???feel like they would fall out. The second version/generation seemed to skimp heavily on materials and quality; the earpieces didn???seem to create a secure fit and they had moved to a cheaper-looking AirPod style case. For this current version; they unsurprisingly took a step back towards the original case; and the buds seem to fit a bit more securely (than v2) even though they??±e obviously using fewer materials. This product is a step back in the right direction but I hope Bose CONTINUES the trend.,749,0.3199,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,749.3199
43,It???not bad they sound good,28,0.2681,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,27.7319
44,Best earbuds I ever had,23,0.3203,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,22.6797
45,There is a problem every time I cross the street. They cancel out until I get to the other end. Yes; it's not good I have to have them replaced,143,0.1793,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,142.8207
46,They fit great and the sound wonderful. The noise canceling is pretty significant.,82,0.274,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,81.726
47,They fit and stay in my ears very well. The sound is exceptional!,65,0.2945,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,64.7055
48,absolutely love them; only use them in the gym and so the battery lasts a whole week :) the only issue i had was that they didn???always disconnect when i put them in the case; but i figured out it was the rings that hindered it from connecting to the case; so i just take them off while i don???use them and add it in the case; so i just write this review so others know about this little hack ^^,397,0.264,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,396.736
49,Awesome sound quality and background noise muffling. Highly recommend these.,76,0.3189,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,75.6811
50,Love the sound quality and noise cancelling it offers; but as design; they look quite big on the ears (might give off the feeling that they might fall off; but they don't).,172,0.3399,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,171.6601
51,Positives: great sound. Easy to connect. Audio features are fantastic. BUT - connection with IOS is a big problem. Disconnect the app from Bluetooth settings to solve it. You will eventually drop sound. So why 3 stars? If you watch a movie or use them to fall asleep there is an auto shutdown feature you can???turn off. After 20 minutes give or take they stop playing and after the battery levels drop you get an update telling you what the level is - it will wake you up. If they can fix the dropped connection issues and especially the auto off problem these would be 5.,573,0.2524,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,573.2524

54,Nice sound - clever design; I love this color. The battery lasts For. Ever. Very happy with this purchase.,106,0.2162,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,105.7838
55,Have always used Apple AirPods These are the best,49,0.317,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,48.683
56,I could not keep these in my ears. I tried for three days straight; switching out each of the three different sizings; and I just could not get them to stay in. I feel I finally understood today how to best position them in my ear; or so I thought I did. This is pretty important as I???a motorcycle rider. Sure enough today; even with the leather strap for my helmet covering these earbuds; they flew away; bye bye. I picked up my AirPods Pro 2???immediately after. This is my third pair of AirPods Pro??? They fit and will never fall off underneath my motorcycle helmet.,572,0.2636,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,572.2636
57,At first the shape and rubber parts are tricky to get used to but oh boy when you get them fitted just right you'll never feel the same about any other design. These earbuds are amazing; they are totally worth their price. I have gotten two of my friends to buy them from just trying them out.,293,0.2989,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,292.7011
58,Had multiple SoundSport ear buds for years. Wasn???sold on the ??o wire??idea; but these are great! Awesome Bose sound with great noise canceling or in the mode to let you also hear what???going on around you. They are compatible with my Bose soundbar; have a long battery life; and the case charges itself and the buds quickly. Excellent Prime Day purchase for me!,365,0.2658,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,364.7342
59,They sound great!,17,0.2752,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,16.7248

62,Fantastic for pairing with smart TV???and great sound quality,61,0.2679,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,60.7321
63,Very comfortable and noise cancelling is excellent ?ëª?battery life is okay on ear buds and great on the charging case. Chargest fast. Sound on my end is clear. Color is adorable! Only issue I've had is that they tend to go into some sort of a rest mode after a while; but it's easy to resume the content when this happens.,322,0.3037,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,321.6963
64,I got these as I wanted a good noise cancelling earbuds. Noise cancelling is good; the battery could definitely be better. I have had a few connection problems but over all great sound and noise cancelling,205,0.3167,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,204.6833
65,I was interested in these earbuds because my wired Bose headphones have been some of the best headphones I've had. The sound quality in these earbuds is decent; although I do prefer my prior set of earbuds from another brand. The case is much bulkier; the buds constantly are announcing things like; 'connected!' (then; 10 seconds later) 'disconnected!' This happens while my music is still playing; so I can only assume it's from my TV connection (this does not happen with my other earbuds in the same context). Additionally; sound will transfer to the Bose earbuds even when they're in the charging case; which is very frustrating when I'm watching TV and then the audio disappears because it has connected to my QCs. The earbuds required 'setup' by downloading an app when I first connected; which was fine; and I appreciate knowing that I can manipulate the features of the earbuds from the app; but it was strange that the app was required instead of optional. There is a feature where you can modify what 'taps' on the side of the buds mean. For example; the default setting is that if you tap the earbud once; it pauses the music / resumes the music. Unfortunately; this is problematic in my experience. If I am listening to music while cleaning my apartment and I feel like my earbud is about to fall out (this happens with all earbud brands so I'm used to it); I'll go to nudge it back into place while my hands are full; but then my music is suddenly paused. With my other earbuds; this doesn't pause my music (or skip songs; or go back a song; etc.) like these do. All of this being said; if the connection / disconnection doesn't bother you; then I would recommend these earbuds. If you have an android phone; these things may not be an issue at all. These are good earbuds with good battery life. If you have a different brand of phone; however; you may want to stick with that brand's recommended buds.,1917,0.2525,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,1917.2525
66,I've owned different Bose earbuds for over a decade. These earbuds I bought because my Quiet Comfort 2 earbuds started to lose battery life and did not last even 6 hours while I was at work. They have been retired to my house where I used them for an hour at a time while on my bike trainer.,291,0.3272,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,290.6728
67,More comfortable and better sound than the Beats Studio Pro. Can't go wrong with BOSE.,86,0.2898,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,85.7102
68,Does not hold a charge longer than 3 hours.,43,0.0914,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,42.9086
69,More comfortable and better sound than the Beats Studio Pro. Can't go wrong with BOSE.,86,0.2898,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,85.7102
70,These are the Best earbuds i get.the sound is the best,54,0.3727,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,53.6273
71,These ear buds are pretty good. The reception is for the lost part good.,72,0.3174,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,71.6826
72,I've been on a mission to find the perfect buds for me. At this point I may as well purchase a custom pair. Something major is always lacking! Fit is great didnt even need to change the ear pieces. They stay in my ear. They're comfortable. Sound is amazing; even with ANC off outside noise is hard to hear. But Bose; why do these sound like they drop sound for a millisecond constantly. Its not like a bluetooth disconnect/reconnect but a noticeable drop in sound repeatedly maybe a static? And dont even get me started on answering phone call others cannot hear you clearly at all. Plus why is the case so large? It bulges out of my pocket. Speaking of large; so are the buds themselves. Can't have it all I guess.,715,0.3219,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,715.3219
73,Love the sound of these. I was hesitant about the fit. I hate they got rid of the old style rubber piece that held them in your ears. These were good until you take them out of your ear and the stability band disappears. You only get one of each size. So I've used my small and my medium and now I'm trying to find replacements. I don't see the bows even sells them I'm going to have to get some aftermarket brand. Other than that I really like them. I'm guessing they've addressed all these issues.,499,0.2651,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,498.7349
74,Fits comfortably in my ears; volume is good; but noise cancel could be better. I have issues with Bluetooth connectivity. There???times when it cuts in and out of connectivity. For the price; I???rather find another quality headphones than this. Fits well for exercises; but it???distracting on a run or during sets for the sound to go in and out.,347,0.2448,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,346.7552
75,Outside of range; this item out does the apple airpods; they sound better; charge a lot quicker; and is far as the battery life goes. I can work almost a complete 12hour shift with just one pod in place; and not having to put it back for another round of charging.,264,0.209,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,263.791
76,I loved the color and for me Bose is always the best,52,0.2335,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,51.7665
77,Good sound quality but they do not stay in your ear.,52,0.3709,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,51.6291
78,If you remain still; the earbuds will cease playback. They are equipped with an auto-pause function that cannot be disabled. If there is no detected movement for 5 to 10 minutes; the earbuds will pause the media. Avoid getting too relaxed; as the earbuds will not continue playing. Auto-pause should be an optional feature rather than a requirement. I sent these back on the same day they arrived.,397,0.22,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,396.78
79,All was fine ..It's just i ordered Black and I got them turquoise,65,0.1366,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,64.8634
80,I had some old Bose QC earbuds with the wing tips and was upset when they quit making those. But these stay in; even during heavy workouts. The old app wasn???bad and the new app kinda sucks. But otherwise; these are great and the noise cancelling is top notch.,261,0.3157,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,260.6843
81,Best earbuds I ever had,23,0.3203,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,22.6797
82,Received the earbuds and loved them; connected them to the BOSE app as instructed and went on living my life.. fast forward a couple months; they were stolen; I went back to the app to find their location.. was surprised to see that BOSE had a ??ew??app to replace the old one. My information for my purchase was no longer connected; and I didn???have the buds to connect to the new app.. When I called to figure it out; the representative from BOSE hung up on me.. I expected more from a leading sound company like BOSE.. now I???out $200; shame on you BOSE!!,560,0.2957,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,560.2957
83,So many reviews about the connectivity issues- I thought; it can't be that bad. Well; I was wrong! Constantly cutting out mid phone call; or randomly one earbud cutting off. Better stay on your toes when listening to anything in public or around other people; because they also have this great feature where they randomly disconnect from Bluetooth; allowing whatever is playing on your device to suddenly start playing out loud for everyone to hear. The quality and noise cancelling seem to be on par with other brands around this price; such as the JBL pro live 2; except less comfortable; and the battery life is awful. Abysmal compared to other earbuds. I thought Bose was supposed to be the best; I guess it's just a ploy nowadays.,735,0.3237,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,735.3237
84,Didn???play sound out of the box. Spent over an hour dealing with their awful chat tech support. It took more time for me to provide them with info; get tossed around between 4 people; then they did troubleshooting. The only solutions they provided were restart the phone; restart the headphones and connect to another device. Never asked anything else. The last option when I said I am just going to return them is that they can give me contact info for a tech in my area to help solve the issue. 100% DO NOT RECOMMEND; extremely frustrating.,543,0.2005,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,543.2005
85,Already having connectivity issues within 30 minutes of unboxing these. They randomly disconnect and when I pick up my device only the right one reconnects. Horrible quality! Bose needs to recall this product and address these issues!!!! Will be returning these.,262,0.2408,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,261.7592
86,High Quality,12,0.1913,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,11.8087
87,Don???bother. These do not hold a charge and I??¶e had connectivity issues every single time I??¶e tried to use these.,116,0.2006,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,115.7994
88,These are the best ear buds I have owned throughout the years. I can have these in my ears for hours and not have any discomfort. No Bluetooth issues; really good noise cancelling for ear buds. I mainly listen to music; audiobooks; and podcasts; and I find the volume ranges really good. And they don't break the bank.,318,0.3558,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,317.6442
89,I owned the first QC earbuds for about 3 years and worked great. The QC2 price was reasonable and cost less than the QC1 earbuds did when i bought them. I upgraded to the QC2 earbuds and were good for a few days. They have multipoint connectivity that worked great; and the sound quality is amazing that Bose is known for. The app was awesome for custom EQ settings although had limited controls. They were fairly comfortable but would become a little irritating after a couple hours of use and always needed some readjustment. Then the earbuds would randomly disconnect from a device or; if connected to two devices; would decide to connect to the other device not being used for no reason and i would have to go into settings to reconnect to whatever was being used. After a week or so i did a product swap assuming i had a faulty pair; but after a day or so the new pair did the same. I returned them and went with the Technics earbuds at a higher price but much better quality.,981,0.2984,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,981.2984
90,Way over priced and the price has been going down so if you want them you can wait. I've tried ever attachment size and if I lean over to pick something up they still have a tendency to fall out; especially if I'm wearing them for a while; the also fall out sometimes and unless they make a noise fall on the ground; I don't feel and fall out of here. There's a lot of bitches trying to connect it to the app so I wasn't able to register the device in time before I already lost an earbud. One I can't for the wife. I can't figure out why Bose has multiple apps to manage it's different devices. That makes no sense for long-term loyal customers. Could you imagine having to go into Google lights and then going into Google home to manage the rest of your devices? For me it has been a huge waste of money. This is my fifth Bose purchase and I've only really loved 1 of 5. I think this might be my last considering their price point. All that said; the sound is great. The aware; and quit settings are great. They also do have a great battery life. I thought if I bought Bose I would finally have a pair of buds that worked well for me but... All in all; I just miss my Google bud a model; best fit so far; decent sound; no bells and whistles.... But remember the most important thing you need when you buy earbuds is for them to stay in.,1338,0.3124,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,1,1338.3124
91,OMG. I put these in my ears without setting them up and they drowned out ALL the noise. husband watching tv; and I can't hear it at all. They work so much better than my 2nd Generation earphones. Best $200 I ever spent,218,0.3155,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,217.6845
92,Very disappointed in the refund process,39,0.1082,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,38.8918
93,They fall out of the ears they don't stay out. The sound great and battery life is great but not user friendly.,111,0.3345,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,110.6655
94,They sound great!,17,0.2752,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,16.7248
95,They were good while they lasted. My left ear no longer works. It won???charge or anything. Biggest waste of money.,115,0.3656,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,114.6344
96,Pros: Great sound and noise cancellation for the money. Touch controls are sufficient. Cons: Terrible on windy days as it produces loud wind noise because the design is not aerodynamic. These would be a terrible running earbuds. Sometimes the connection is not stable when walking which is annoying and don't know what it is.,325,0.2775,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,324.7225
97,The fit is ok. The noise reduction is incredible! The sound is great. But the charging indicator absolutely sucks! I've only had them a few months and numerous times I've put them in my ears only to find they're dead. The indicator was 'orange' but it wasn't enough to charge the earphones. I've got $40 earphones with much better charge indicators. I've basically had to plug the damn things in any time the indicator isn't green. Fix that and they would be outstanding!,471,0.2753,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,470.7247
98,Definitely not the quality of other Bose earbuds. I can???get the noise cancelling to work fully. I can???get the right earbud to work at full capacity. Very disappointed,170,0.3093,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,169.6907
99,The most useless device; left ear device just got over heated while charging and stopped charging and later the right ear also stopped working. Please do not waste your hard earned money. Don't buy; mine didn't work for a week.,227,0.273,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,226.727
100,Awesome sound quality and background noise muffling. Highly recommend these.,76,0.3189,earbuds,Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Ear,0,75.6811
1,The sound quality is the best. However the touch controls are marginal. I had the previous generation TCW2 and they were great but these are far from it.,153,0.2823,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,152.7177
2,Noice,5,0.0565,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,4.9435
3,I've had these for over a month now. They are well worth the hype. My father has used this brand for many years as wired headphones. When I was in the market for new headphones being my Sony's finally gave out; he recommend Sennheiser. They are better then the $200 pair of Sony's I purchased in 2020 that died. You will hear stuff in songs that you never heard before. Make sure you fit these correctly; download the app and follow the hearing test and get it all set for you. These also act as really good noise cancelling headphones; when using as hands free Bluetooth; there's tons of unique controls you can customize yourself; the also fit my small ears very well and do not fall out even in the gym.,706,0.3555,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,706.3555
4,Sennheiser is the best and everyone should know that,52,0.2839,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,51.7161
5,Sound quality is great; I love the feel of the case. Charges quickly. However; it didn???last long for the price. I??¶e had for 9 months now and the left earbud has completely stopped working. The right is super glitchy. It doesn???register the taps (ie tap 2 times on right ear bud to change a setting) anymore except for pause and start. I had high hopes but disappointed in long term quality.,394,0.3225,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,393.6775
6,After 5 monthes use the right side not work,43,0.0758,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,42.9242
7,So the sound quality is great on these. However; I will admit that these did break on me after a year. But Sennheiser is still a company which will always get my money because I sent them in for repair and I was sent an entirely new set within a week. So maybe don't buy this specific model if you can't afford the replace them if they break after the 2 year warranty period is up(idk seems reasonable for earbuds at least); but honestly still buy Sennheiser products if you want quality and excellent customer service. (I promise I'm not a paid reviewer or anything; I'm just astonished they sent me a new pair no questions asked),631,0.3591,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,631.3591
8,Loved them at first; then after about 6 months the right bud quit working. It would charge and connect but no sound except occasional ear-piercing high pitched squelches. The warranty process is absurd and very far behind other competitor products and just other companies generally. I am very disappointed by the support given that this is supposed to be a premium product.,374,0.3215,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,373.6785
9,Excellent sound. Good range. These sound better than any earbuds I have ever had. I am so glad I got them.,106,0.3327,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,105.6673
10,This device eats down so hard; like everyday I thank the girlies up in Sennheiser HQ for making this. This is so much more convenient than a big chunky headphone; so I love this; and the size of the case is perfect for my Lulu Lemon bag; as well as the case being this nice texture. Like; I literally will scratch it with my fingers cus it's so satisfying. Another thing is that the earbuds work well. I love the bass it produces; and the fact that I can have my own sound system within the app is great. What I also appreciate is the consistency between the controls from the Momentum 4s to the TWs. It is so easy to learn and practical for quick changes in listening. Another thing is that people have been complaining about the connection; but I had no problem. As soon as I charged it for like 10 minutes; it was at 40%; and that is just insane to me. I love this product and I will continue to bring it with me everywhere I go. Love you girlies!!,953,0.3353,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,953.3353
11,These are; without dramatisation; the WORST pair I've had in terms of reliability. Within a span of 12 months I've had to RMA them 4 times; and shortly after my warranty expired; they broke again. One of the sides would abruptly and without reason stop working every time. Extremely fragile product whose wiring seems to easily get loose simply due to normal use. Also; a note about call quality -- they have no background noise filtration for the recipient. People constantly complained about noise; and even hearing me breathe or chew food. And forget about talking outside -- it was impossible; people just could hear me at all due to even low wind or traffic noise. So basically; you get practically non existent quality control for a premium price. Put your money elsewhere.,779,0.2776,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,779.2776
12,When these headphones work they are phenomenal. However; I have spend hours over the last couple of days trying to get these to work with my iPhone with no success. They no longer play audio or connect at all after a dozen factory resets and scrolling through every obscure forum looking for advice. The Smart Control app is basically useless as well. Sennheiser has no idea how to fix it. As far as I am aware nobody there has the ability to remedy the issues with these headphones. Do yourself a favor and set $200 on fire before you buy this and ask yourself how it feels because that???basically the equivalent to the experience of using these headphones.,659,0.3078,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,659.3078
13,sound is decent; but did not open my third eye. in-ear fit is nice. mic quality is about in line with what one might expect for wireless bluetooth iems (don't expect much). the left earbud has; after seven months of ~daily usage; died. i have not dropped these; nor submerged them in water. unfortunate; as every other sennheiser i've owned has been wonderful. these; however; are not worth the price; and i'd recommend you investigate other candidates.,453,0.3274,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,452.6726
14,I don???recommend that you buy these ear phones.First off the Bluetooth connection is shaky and the signal is constantly interrupted between the two ear pieces.They have a great sound and I was impressed by that but having the sound cut out frequently was bad.After 6 months of use the left ear piece stopped working completely. I have been having useless email conversations with the same questions being asked over and over but no interest in providing service. I am starting to think that they don???want to replace or even repair them.,539,0.3253,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,539.3253
15,I purchased mine in March 2024 and about 3 weeks ago (8-2025) my left ear bud when I move my jaw (eating; talking) SCREAMS into my ear at what must be maximum volume. I was happy with mine and they were my main for everything. I went online to the official website; and they only warranty for 12 months... Then; I look at the bottom and guess where the earbuds are made... NOT Germany...,387,0.2215,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,386.7785
16,I got a pair of the momentum 3's a few years ago. They lasted about a year and a half until one ear just died from regular use. I was within the warranty so sennheiser sent me a pair of momentum 4s as a replacement. Those lasted about a months; same issue one of the ears just went dead one day from regular use. Mind you I took great care of these ear buds. The sound quality and noise canceling are great but be aware they will last you around a year at best so the value for money isn't great.,496,0.2972,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,495.7028
17,My biggest gripe is that they usually do not turn off after x amount of time when they are no longer receiving a signal. Too often; I pop them in to find that the battery is dead or nearly dead because of this. They are terrible at pausing when removed from your ear temporarily. I often find that they have kept playing after setting them down for a few minutes. Finally; sometimes they are just reluctant to connect to devices or switch connections and I have to put them back in the case to reset them. If you are on a run or elsewhere when this happens and don't have the case; you might be out of luck.,607,0.2655,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,607.2655
18,If sound quality is your only concern; then these are pretty good. If you want something that just works and doesn't get in your way; look elsewhere.,149,0.3294,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,148.6706
19,I bought the Momentum 2s in late 2021?ë´Ÿy mid-2024; one speaker was dead. Out of warranty; out of luck. Foolishly; I purchased the Momentum 4s. Fifteen months in; the left speaker flickers like a failed solder joint. Touch controls work; sound doesn??? That???$500 and two failed pairs in under four years. Their 1-year warranty says it all?ë´–ennheiser doesn???even believe their earbuds will last over a year. Treated with care; electronics should last several years of normal use. A company that takes hard-earned money for what they advertise as ??†igh end??but delivers junk deserves every bit of criticism.,608,0.2557,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,608.2557
20,If you??¶e had similar issues; consider filing a complaint with your state attorney general???consumer protection office or the Better Business Bureau. Multiple reports can help highlight patterns and prompt investigations.,222,0.0678,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,221.9322
21,The sound quality of the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 is truly excellent?ë´ lear; immersive; and well-balanced. Unfortunately; after just 10 months of use; one of the earbuds started malfunctioning. The audio would cut in and out; as if there were a loose internal connection or faulty wiring.,298,0.2821,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,297.7179
22,While the product comes with a 2-year warranty; the repair process requires you to pay for shipping; and the repair/replacement takes 3 to 5 weeks. Given the cost and time involved; it simply isn???worth it. For that reason; I can???recommend this product despite its great audio performance.,292,0.1562,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,291.8438
23,I've owned these earbuds for two years and one month; so just outside of the warranty. I really enjoyed the audio quality of these earbuds. They excel in mids and highs with decent bass; but if you are looking for bass heavy audio these earbuds are not for you. The ANC is good but will create static if something like a lawn mower is running. The builds for durability is nice and they've held up well considering I use them everyday while working a trades job. I honestly would give these a five star review if not for one important thing. The battery longevity of these are.... not good. The right earbud battery life went from lasting 4 hours to about 30 minutes in about two weeks. After checking online it appears there is no easy way to replace the batteries in the earbuds. So you are paying a hefty price just to throw them out in two years. It's really disappointing that Sennheiser won't change the design to make it easier to replace and many other people have mentioned their customer service won't do anything for them if you are outside of the warranty. I'm going to try and get them fixed at a local shop; but from what I've seen from other people's reviews I'm doubtful,1186,0.3148,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,1186.3148
24,These sound amazing when (if) they connect. It's a shame because for the most part these are just all around great.,115,0.3022,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,114.6978
25,Awesome sound; great fit and the app is very customizable and also has find my ear buds which Bose doesn't offer in their overpriced earbuds. If you like Bose...you will absolutely love these!!,193,0.3195,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,192.6805
26,Sound so good it's like the band is sitting right here in front of me. I have every set of Sennheiser headphones created and each one gets better and better. Standing by for #5 to drop.,185,0.33,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,184.67
27,The earbuds charge fairly quickly; but the battery life is only 4-5 hours. 1st set I got had audio clicking issues in one of the ears. The noise canceling is okay; but really not all that great for the price.,208,0.2894,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,207.7106
28,I had the momentum 2 and 3??. they lasted less than 3 months apparently if they lose full charge they don???recharge ?? Customer service SUCKS??and they don???back their product ?ìª¨VOID!!,186,0.1822,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,185.8178
29,These are a slap in the face from a brand and company I have come to trust for wireless earbuds. I ordered the initial TWM 1 in 2019; and since ordered the CX and CX+. Despite costing 3 times the price as the CX+; the fit is uncomfortable and less stable; the touch controls are less responsive; the sound is worse; and they broke within 3 months of purchase. To make matters worse; attempts to fulfill the warranty for the past month have been met with countless hoops to jump through.,486,0.3122,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,485.6878
30,Seriously I just want my money back at this point. This product is not even a year old and is already not charging correctly. I??¶e had the MTW2;3 and now 4s?ìª?don???know why I keep thinking they will fix these earbuds with a new generation. I???not wanting to send these in for repair again; I??¶e done that so many times with the previous models. This product is simply not built to last and that equates it to garbage. Please let me know how I can recoup my hundreds of dollars for this product and I will find something else. Maybe you guys could send me a wired pair of earbuds for similar value?,599,0.2887,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,599.2887
31,These earbuds are amazing. Sennheiser does not disappoint; ever. I have several Sennheiser headphones and earbuds and I love all of them. Their sound quality is the best and I love the design...the don't look like stupid airpods.,229,0.3706,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,228.6294
32,Right earbud is not working after only 6 months of use. Not to mention the terrible bluetooth connection issues that these have. I have to constantly restart my phone just so these connect. A lot of the time; if you have one earbud in and put the other one in after some time; you have to disconnect and reconnect your bluetooth connection just to get the other one to work. Back to what I first said; super awesome that my right earbud is already busted; one random morning putting these in; my right earbud kept crackling and popping; then it just stopped working completely; it doesn't even connect anymore. Wouldn't recommend; ridiculously expensive over engineered german garbage.,685,0.2902,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,685.2902
33,Keeps disconnecting while on the call,37,0.0633,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,36.9367
34,Got these last year on a Black Friday sale. Absolutely fantastic sound quality. Not the greatest for phone usage though. Unfortunately; they have already broken. One side still functions but produces no sound. Make sure to hold onto your receipt; cause it's a known issue and sennheiser will replace if within the year warranty. I; unfortunately; did not keep mine.,365,0.3513,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,364.6487
35,Died in under a year. Likely due to ear-moisture (some sweat when I walk) but unclear.,86,0.1636,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,85.8364
36,I have had these buds for 8 months; and for sound alone they are top of my favorites! Also have an excellent app....Haven't babied them; and they have been working smooth without any issues. Recommended!!,204,0.3536,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,203.6464
37,Headphones would be great; but about 3-4 months into owning the left headphone went out and no one would get back to me at all. Now about 8 months later the right ones are starting to make weird noises even if I turn my head. Would not recommend. For the price it should last more than a year at least.,302,0.2608,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,301.7392
38,These earbuds are definitely high quality; and have excellent ANC. But they have more connectivity issues; are quieter than; and have worse battery life than a $30 pair of buds I got. They don't last through my work shift; so I shuffle the buds during my shift; and aren't very loud even with an equalizer. Overall; the earbuds themselves are decent. But the price to quality ratio is outrageous. Comfort is decent; ease of use varies; and the size is sleek. If you want to drop a money bomb so you can enjoy a few hours of high quality; but quiet .. High quality and quiet eh? Sounds pretentious.,597,0.3038,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,597.3038
39,Amazing sound quality. Easy touch controls. Good battery life. I have the Momentum 4 headphones they are also excellent; sometimes tough to keep handy due to the size. The momentum 4 true wireless are perfect for going in a pocket. Great audio range highs; mids; and lows. Great separation of sound. Awesome call quality stood in-front of a 42 shop fan on high and had a clear conversation. Multiple ear tips included; try a few for the perfect fit. In the extreme heat they are not as hot as the Momentum 4 headphones. The app is easy to use with the equalizer; and all other functions. You do get what you pay for; high quality; and performance.,647,0.3433,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,647.3433
40,Horrible connectivity; will disconnect constantly during workouts or even at the office while not moving. Great sound quality; what you???expect but can???get past having to reconnect every 30 seconds. I love my 599s and hd 660s but wish I would of went with Sony again for EarPods.,282,0.2678,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,281.7322
41,I have no idea how these things ever got as popular as they are or how anyone could ever give them a good review. The sound quality is merely on par with other earbuds like samsungs galaxy buds. The functionality is absolutely terrible. Connection issues alllllll the time. Sometimes its the right ear; sometimes its the left; but there's a solid chance when you take them out the case one or both won't connect. When they do connect it ALWAYS switches you to ANC; even if you try to set it to something else. I've tried everything; even the geofencing and nothing works. If you switch to 'transparency'; which is an awesome feature; it pauses what your listening to; every. Single. Time. I fight with these things more than I get to listen to them. I just spent a 10 minute drive trying to work before I go inthe store and here I sit; in the parking lot 15 minutes later writing this review with them still not connecting. Save your money.,940,0.3519,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,940.3519
42,If you are an audiophile and you want clear earbuds that rival high-end over-the-ear phones; this is what you want. The clarity in well done mixes extraordinary. This is my second set of Sennheizer earbuds The first was the the CX; was a disappointment. So much so Sennheiser replaced them. The replacement set was an vast improvement; which suggested the issue was the build quality. I also experienced problems with their low-end wired phones. The Jack always needed jiggling. I???old enough to remember the Sennheiser of the 80???; you know with the yellow pads. They lasted over 30 years. It looks like Sennheiser is back with these. Highly recommend !,656,0.2871,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,656.2871
43,I have tried numerous earbuds and although these are probably the most comfortable; the sound quality is terrible. I like a lot of bass and these just don???sound good. Bose by far has the best sound quality; although not as comfortable as these.,246,0.3193,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,245.6807
44,I compared this premium product against the Sony and Bose varieties; both of which I've owned. I was hoping this would have been a replacement that landed between the two and I'm sad to report it falls far below both. Currently; the Sony premium product sells for $50 to $60 less than this and far outperforms it. I'll be giving these to my kid to use while I purchase the WF-1000mx5 earbuds to replace my series 4 that I lost.,427,0.3134,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,426.6866
45,First pair of these earbuds failed with the right earbud developing a crackling and popping sound; then the earbud completely failed. Never dropped; keep them clean; never got them wet or anything. The exact same thing just happened to the replacement set; replaced under warranty. Exact same issue; and have found others with the exact same issue. There is an obvious design flaw in the right earbud; stay away from these.,423,0.2565,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,422.7435
46,For the longest time I only ever used samsung galaxy buds or jlab go air pop buds. Finally I decided to upgrade my main earbuds and decided on these. Simply the best sound I have ever heard in a wireless earbud! Even better than my galaxy buds 2. These fit in my ears do well and never fall out. They are larger and the case is a bit bulky but I feel it is a fair trade due to the sound being far better. Senheisser is no joke!,427,0.3268,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,426.6732
47,Not one complaint; clear; top quality audio. Very well made product,67,0.2907,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,66.7093
48,have had alot of high end ear buds but never one that has really strong bass replication. These are shockingly great. multiple levels of noise cancelation from 100% deaf to complete passthrough. worth the price,210,0.3073,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,209.6927
49,I was highly disappointed! On one hand these earbuds sound amazing; they are well balanced and with Sennheiser + App; you can really fine tune them. Getting the fit right was a little work but they offer a couple choices to get the perfect fit. I like the functionality and the battery life is pretty top notch. The ANC needs a little improvement but it???not horrible and the transparency mode is actually pretty good. Overall hands down the best earbuds I have experienced. But all this means nothing if they don???work. A week ago the left earbud sound went out; and I do want to emphasize just the sound; because everything else pretty much works. Contacted Asurion of course because I read the reviews and the extra $32 buck appeared worth it; of course until they tell you go to the manufacturer because it???still within warranty. Okay no biggie; just 30 minutes of my life spent getting no help. So I reach out to Sennheiser and you guessed it; I was told since I had Asurion to go to them. Anger ensued; so I contacted Amazon and they are refunding my purchase; still waiting.,1085,0.3394,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,1085.3394
50,Great earbuds,13,0.3445,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,12.6555
51,Why did you pick this product vs others?: I researched to buy for my partner and he ended up wanting to return them and repurchase AirPods. He used the app to customize the sound; but he said he didn???want that and just something to pop in for phone calls or whatever. I???sure these are great; but he just isn???a person who obsesses over sounds and whatnot. Idk sorry yall. The battery life seemed to tower over AirPods while he had them; but the case was kinda bulky for his liking. ,487,0.3169,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,486.6831
52,Why did you pick this product vs others?: Sound great; amazing. But for the love of God; if you want to make a phone call; these are worthless. The mics suck and no one can every hear me. I replaced the first set thinking it was a defect. The second set has the same issue. HORRIBLE FOR PHONE CALLS. My TW CXplus did not have this issue. 300 for audiophile listening; I guess.,376,0.2787,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,375.7213
53,Not worth the money. Software is hot hot garbage. Over engineered like typical German stuff. Battery lasts 5 hours so I don't know where they got the 50 hours from exactly. The TW2 was much much better. I recommend buying something else.,237,0.0935,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,236.9065
54,It doesn't meet my expectations; a very low volume can be heard outside even canceling out the outside sound.,109,0.176,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,108.824
55,At first they were great and the settings and features were nice. But after three months of use the right earbuds randomly started crackling and kept going up and down in sound level. Very disappointed since these cost $50 more than the AirPod pro 2 and my first gen AirPod pros lasted me 3 years.,297,0.358,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,296.642
56,I saw a lot of mixed reviews for these; and was a little worried to pick them up; but I love Sennheiser's other headphones; so I decided to give these a shot after giving up on my Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I've been using them for a few days; and my first impressions are solid. I'm not a full on audiophile; but I also do have more standards for my headphones than the average person; so from that perspective; they sound really good! The build quality is also great too; the fabric case feels premium compared to the plastic cases other brands ship with. My only problem I have with them right now is the ANC. It works great; but I wear a beanie most of the time outside; and it picks up the slight shuffling of it when I walk. On the bright side; you can program a toggle to turn ANC and Transparency on/off separately; which means I can quickly hear what others are saying or turn ANC off when I get off the bus to walk. Overall; I'd say I really like them so far! I only use them with my phone; no connecting them to other devices; so that might be why I'm having a better experience than others. Connections issues galore; poor user experience. Pieces of it coming unglued within 2 months of use. When connection is good audio quality is great so 2 stars all around.,1265,0.3453,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,1265.3453
57,Same issues as the mtw3; speakers will eventually get clogged and the little mesh pieces will fall out. Sounds similar to mtw3 but not worth the price or problems. Buy something else,182,0.2119,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,181.7881
58,I bought these twice; because i lost my first pair. I have never come across a pair of headphones that sound this good; as far as sound quality; battery life; design goes these things are right up there with the best. with that said the connection software; and driver foundation is garbage; connection issues; sound going out; loosing connection; random switching between devices; not being recognized when turned on. one bud has sound randomly and not the other. Please replace your Bluetooth drivers and software stack for connectivity for the 5th version i would very much like a pair but not if it has the issues the 4s do.,628,0.3029,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,628.3029
59,Has a battery that isn't even that big of an improvement over the momentum 3s. It constantly disconnects whenever I remove it from my ear and place it in I'm pocket. I really don't understand how you can royally mess up earbuds this much like why ??¶How does a product this expensive come with such an obvious and obnoxious design flaw.,335,0.2571,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,334.7429
60,the sounds are horrible compared to the sony's i would not get them again. do not buy do not buy!,97,0.2847,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,96.7153
61,Terrible Quality for $200. I've had better experience with $30 earbuds then these. They started having connectivity issues and mic issues only 2 months in. The bass is also really light on these.,195,0.2775,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,194.7225
62,I have had these for 4 months now the left earbud stopped working. The case is built cheap and terrible the earbuds feel like there always trying to come out the battery Is the only good thing; the price is horrible; the noise cancelation and audio could be a million times better a pair of Samsung earbuds outclassed these. Stay away,334,0.3421,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,333.6579
63,Bought these exactly 2 years ago; and they just died. Right bud died first a few days ago; and left bud died today. Right bud status light occasionally has a white flicker; left bud occasionally flashes red/green a few times and sometimes has a similar white flicker. Factory reset procedure from p41 of manual does nothing. Case pulses charging light forever.,360,0.1104,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,359.8896
64,Before buying this; I tried the Apple Bose comfort series. Apple's noise reduction is halfway poor. Bose's noise reduction is top-level. The sound quality is above average; but the quality problem is serious. I often take off one earphone and then put it on again; and it doesn't sound. Sennheiser's noise reduction is not as good as Bose's. The sound quality is very good. It has been stable for a few days and the quality is OK.,430,0.2883,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,429.7117
65,If you want to stand on stage with the musicians or sit in the recording studio next to the mix engineer these are the ear buds. Classic Sennheiser quality; you can wear these without ear fatigue; also the app is well laid out with different options.,250,0.2658,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,249.7342
66,Very nice earbuds with good sound quality; but keep in mind they will probably go dead within a few months. My right earbud completely died; and I had to spend $15 on insured shipping to Sennheiser to get it fixed. Knowing the reputation of these earbuds; I will probably have to do that several more times.,307,0.355,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,306.645
67,Ordered these about 2 months ago. They were working great until I started running into issues with loose wiring inside the right ear piece a few days ago. I get static; scratching; and feedback to where it hurts to listen to; and I'm disappointed in how quickly the quality has degraded in such a short time. I don't recommend picking these up. Update: shortly after posting this review; the right earbud's audio stopped working completely. I have changed the rating from 2 stars to 1 star. This is completely unacceptable.,523,0.3599,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,523.3599
68,Stopped working after 11 months - just like the last 2 generations of this product I have purchased. These product is not long lasting; is prone to weird audio ticks and glitchy sounds and connectivity isn't always immediate or easy. When they work; they do have good noise cancellation and I like using the app to customize the settings. It is clear that; despite being Sennheiser; the product quality is getting worse over time; especially when you buy from Amazon. If you buy this product; I recommend going through the actual merchant because they're giving Amazon the garbage versions.,590,0.3303,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,590.3303
69,Great sound; some connectivity issues but Sennheiser customer service is very helpful if you run into them.,107,0.3205,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,106.6795
70,A year into using this; the right bud started giving distortions in noise and loud screeches when I move my head a little ; even by a cm. My momentum wireless 3 were so much better.,181,0.2424,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,180.7576
71,My upgrade from version 2 to 4 was well worth the money. The lossless connection option using the USB Audio Player Pro with my Samsung S24 Ultra phone sounds amazing.,166,0.2066,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,165.7934
72,These buds are good out of the box BUT they are GREAT after burnt in a few months. The bass is well balanced; not over-bearring; the high-hats are crisp; n clear; n I???hearring parts that were covered up or hidden in the music with my other buds. Separation is incredible!! Highly recommend the M4; just give m a chance to burn in n they come alive!!!,352,0.3075,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,351.6925
73,Left earbud completely stopped working after 6 months. The audio quality is amazing but they just don't hold up. The momentum 3s had the same problem,149,0.2904,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,148.7096
74,In today's world it seems people get a defective set an automatically want to destroy a company by saying to 'stay away' or 'don't buy'. I don't believe in that. Every company should have a fair trial. I bought these today and will give updates when possible. So far these are amazing. The sound quality is a chef's kiss! The buds feel sturdy and they don't feel like they're going to fall apart. The magnetic case looks clean and the quality does not disappoint either. The price is totally worth for the sound alone. The app on the phone is intuitive and very easy to navigate. This headset is truly worth it if you're an audiophile and or your looking for quality in a product.,680,0.35,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,680.35
75,Customer service sucks; app sucks; audio quality is nice; but hopefully you don???have any issues cause it??ªl take weeks for a reply and more than likely it won???be resolved. Lost an earbud and they wanted me to buy another pair; but said a spare could work just fine; bought a spare and it bricked both earbuds. 430$ not spent well at all. Sadly this is my third pair of Sennheiser wireless earbuds and probably my last. Find my earbuds feature in their app is as helpful as just looking blindly.,498,0.3198,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,497.6802
76,I bought these in Summer (June or July) 2024; and by Spring 2025 one of the earbuds has completely stopped working. Before the left earbud stopped working; I would occasionally receive complaints regarding voice sound quality when speaking to others. Sennheiser generally makes good products but I am disappointed that I wasted money for less than a year of use out of these. Avoid.,382,0.294,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,381.706
77,I've had all types of ear buds went with these bc I thought they were high end the right one just quit working. The company won???reimburse me. I do not recommend buying anything from them most likely to have issues like I did and Amazon will not replace.,255,0.319,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,254.681
78,I bought the Sennheiser momentum twos and they worked beautifully until I lost them. I found them several years later out of warranty. The case would recharge but the buds would not charge and of course Sennheiser provided zero customer help.,242,0.2919,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,241.7081
79,Cheap junk. I bought a pair of TW3s that needed to be returned for warranty at least 6 times. They eventually sent me these as a replacement. These lasted 6 months (longer than the last model usually did!) but finally crapped out yesterday morning. I spent more paying to ship these back for replacements than I would've just buying a brand new pair from another brand.,369,0.2596,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,368.7404
80,With time it would stop to work; really I love them; but the life quality is disappointing by the reason that the left airbud stops working by the next 3 to 4 months.,166,0.1918,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,165.8082
81,Don't spend any dollars on these earbuds.,41,0.3191,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,40.6809
82,Two major complaints that make this 01 star product. First being that they are not good for talking on the phone; the person on the other end cannot hear you properly as they can with other headphones. Mic quality is perhaps not good? Anyway at over $200 they should be more usable for phone calls. Also my charging case quit working entirely after 7 months. I am now unable to charge earbuds. No replacement charging case available. They may be covered by warranty; I did call customer support. I have to pay to send them in and it's a pain. All in all pretty decent sound quality; decent earbuds; for the price though not worth it.,633,0.3065,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,633.3065
83,There's no question these Sennheiser ear buds sound amazing. The noise cancellation is also excellent. Over the years; I purchased version 1 and 2; and in October 2024; I bought version 4. Unfortunately; all of these are defective in some way. In each case; one side failed in less than a year. The left side of version 4 failed last month - it charges; the blue connection light is on; but no sound; in less than 6 months. That's close to $600 per year to continue buying these when they fail. Sennheiser support has refused to answer my support ticket for weeks now. I won't buy Sennheiser products ever again.,612,0.3516,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,612.3516
84,Got these because I wanted something with a better mic than Bose Quietcomfort Ultra buds for work; but with a similar sound quality; music sounds great in these; especially after customizing; but audio books and podcasts sound hallow like they're not all the way in your ear; I'll be returning them because I'd rather just stick with the better overall sound of the Bose,370,0.3426,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,369.6574
85,I had high hopes for this because of the brand. Unfortunately; it fell way short. I have a $40 Soundcore pair that are superior to these. I could??¶e saved about $200. There is a constant hissing noise that cannot be cleared up; no matter what you do. I thought the updates might make it better; but it did nothing. Podcast are really annoying with this constant hissing sound. It gets better when you play music. Until they fix these issues; I cannot recommend this product. I wanted to really like these. Instead I???left with an overpriced under performing product. I don???mind paying more for a premium product; but these are not.,634,0.2774,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,634.2774
86,I really wanted to love these buds; as I owned and regularly wore the Momentum 3???until they went through the washing machine. After trying them on with the med tips; I noticed both ears had sound leakage (more so on my L ear) and allowed too much ambient sound in while wearing. After testing all three sized tips I realized the tips are essentially single ply toilet paper thin and very flimsy; no seal with any of the sizes. The 1 time I managed to finesse them into sealing; only accomplishing with them almost dangling out of my ear and not secure at all; they sounded amazing. With some tweaking within the app; I found a solid balance of sound (I???a mega bass head). They just lost me completely with needing to spend additional money right away if I wanted a foam tip option that creates an actual seal. Granted; everyone???ear canal is different; but I??¶e never had this bad of sound leakage on a $300 pair of buds. Returned after a few days.,953,0.2887,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,953.2887
87,I had a pair of original Momentums which were great and still work well. I only purchased these because my ear piece came off and I had to put a small one on to keep using them. The Momentum 4 is an inferior product. I knew it the first day I opened them and should have returned them immediately. Sadly; I did not and now the return window is closed. DON'T BUY THESE. The sound quality is awful and ear fit is not what the old ones were.,438,0.2605,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,437.7395
88,Awesome earbuds!,16,0.3204,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,15.6796
89,Not even a year; and these headphones are horrible. Left bud wont connect; and static when in use. A waste of money.,116,0.2391,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,115.7609
90,Very bad product! There are constant connection problems; never buy this product again!,87,0.1667,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,86.8333
91,These earbuds are definitely high quality; and have excellent ANC. But they have more connectivity issues; are quieter than; and have worse battery life than a $30 pair of buds I got. They don't last through my work shift; so I shuffle the buds during my shift; and aren't very loud even with an equalizer. Overall; the earbuds themselves are decent. But the price to quality ratio is outrageous. Comfort is decent; ease of use varies; and the size is sleek. If you want to drop a money bomb so you can enjoy a few hours of high quality; but quiet .. High quality and quiet eh? Sounds pretentious.,597,0.3038,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,597.3038

93,I really tried hard to like them. I love the design; see how awesome they look with my SUUNTO! I love the sound; it is great; no connectivity issues. ANC is a bit of a pressure and you may feel it when turned on; anti wind seems to be doing its job pretty good too. BUT! The buds are terribly uncomfortable in the ear; not matter what bud tips I use. I just cant stop thinking how annoying that feeling is when I wear them. Its like I got a dice in my ear that produce pretty decent sound. The buds are unbalanced (weight wise) and they feel like they are about to fall out of your ear. Its just poor ergonomics that could easily be addressed in 4th gen and doesn't require lots of investments. But Sennheiser think good sound is good enough; while I think differently. And yes; the mic is just unacceptably terrible. Forget about phone conversations and voice messages. No; thanks. I will return these and I'm leaning towards Bose QC Ultra; which sound almost as great but are incomparably comfortable in my ear; I can literally wear them for hours. (their mic is crap too :) I would rate these 3.5; but will give them the benefit of the doubt and go 4; since that is not an option on Amazon. Very good sound quality; but difficult to find an ear-tip size that was comfortable for me. ANC is only moderately okay; but could be better with higher quality tips. App was somewhat problematic and occasionally would not connect. At the end of the day; I was not willing to invest the time or money for better tips. I prefer the Technics AZ100 line or Sony WF-1000XM5 for the money. I bought these twice; because i lost my first pair. I have never come across a pair of headphones that sound this good; as far as sound quality; battery life; design goes these things are right up there with the best. with that said the connection software; and driver foundation is garbage; connection issues; sound going out; loosing connection; random switching between devices; not being recognized when turned on. one bud has sound randomly and not the other. Please replace your Bluetooth drivers and software stack for connectivity for the 5th version i would very much like a pair but not if it has the issues the 4s do.,2207,0.3409,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,2207.3409
94,The sound quality of these is very good. The tap features work pretty flawlessly and the transparency mode is great for stopping and chatting with folks without have to remove the buds. If it weren't for the following issues; I'd give these 5 stars. First; they provide four different earbud tip sizes; and 3 varieties of the wings. For longer term wearing; like multiple hour walks with my dog; every combination of the aforementioned tips/wings would not stay in my ear; and the constant shifting was irritating to my ears. Secondly; on social media ads as well as the title of the Amazon listing itself are very deceptive in my opinion. This product touts an impressive 30 hour battery life; what they don't tell you; especially in the Facebook ad is that the 30 hours is for the CHARGING CASE; not the earbuds themselves. To me; this is very sneaky wording. That said; the battery does last for what seems to be 5-7 hours depending on which features are being used (active nosie cancelation; higher listening volumes; etc). To be perfectly honest; I was going to return these as the comfort issue is a major detractor for me; while other reviews seem to say these are extremely comfortable. I have other wired earbuds with similar silicon tips that do no irritate my ears. All of thar said; I ordered memory foam replacement tips which are said to match the Momemtum true wireless 3 buds; but they fit into this model fine and greatly increase the comfort and fit. With these new tips (not sold my Sennheisier); I will keep them but keep these issues in mind if you're looking into purchasing them.,1602,0.3455,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,1602.3455
95,These sound distinctly a lot better than other earbuds I have tried; or heard. I tried very hard to like Sony's wireless earbuds and while the sound quality was acceptable and the software seemingly great. My latest XM5s only lasted about 3 months before they mysteriously become so quiet I can't even hear them anymore. No it's not high volume and hearing degradation. Those headphones just stopped delivering and the same happened with the XM4 but; it took closer to 6 months. Battery life still seemed to hit the same targets but; who cares when you can't hear your ANC earbuds over the quiet speakers at the gym. So; that comes to the main point; these earbuds are brand new; I don't know how they hold up and plan to update the review to reflect this. Anyways... For now; I am wowed. I love high end headphones and use a dac and an amp with my typical wired Sennheiser HD650 headphones. These surprise me since they sound comparably nice while still having to deal with Bluetooth interference. The Sony earbuds can't even come close to comparing. Listening to music on these is a whole nother experience; like with my wired setup I notice subtlety in the production of the music I love that I don't through normal earbuds or through my car's stereo. These are quite amazing HiFi headphones for the price. I just really hope the batteries inside will continue to provide this excellence! First impression leaves me saying for the price; and in comparison to competitors these are a must buy but; who knows how they will last.,1529,0.3364,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,1529.3364
96,Great sound and great noise cancelling. The app has a lot of nice features to customize the experience and automatically enable/disable the noise cancelling to make it easier to chat while wearing the buds. The silicon ear tips were useless. These buds and beefy and need some decent force from the tips to hold the buds in your ear. The silicon tips that were provided did not get the job done. I replaced these with Comply memory foam tips and problem solved. For the price I paid; why not just provide a set of memory foam tips with the silicon tips? Dinging one star because of the hassle to get the memory foam.,616,0.353,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,616.353
97,These sound good. I don't get hyped when listening to them. Thing about me is I'm brutally honest and I never ride hype trains. These sound good and give you decent listening. Volume isn't loud enough. They sit on my shelf and collect dust. I do enjoy them just not going to tell you they're fun and they'll change your life. They're good. They have bass but volume lacks. I'm sort of hard of hearing especially when working out. These don't do much for me.,457,0.2714,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,456.7286
98,If you are an audiophile and you want clear earbuds that rival high-end over-the-ear phones; this is what you want. The clarity in well done mixes extraordinary. This is my second set of Sennheizer earbuds The first was the the CX; was a disappointment. So much so Sennheiser replaced them. The replacement set was an vast improvement; which suggested the issue was the build quality. I also experienced problems with their low-end wired phones. The Jack always needed jiggling. I???old enough to remember the Sennheiser of the 80???; you know with the yellow pads. They lasted over 30 years. It looks like Sennheiser is back with these. Highly recommend !,656,0.2871,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,1,656.2871
99,Sound so good it's like the band is sitting right here in front of me. I have every set of Sennheiser headphones created and each one gets better and better. Standing by for #5 to drop.,185,0.33,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,184.67
100,These sound amazing when (if) they connect. It's a shame because for the most part these are just all around great.,115,0.3022,earbuds,Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wirele,0,114.6978
1,Color quality great; comfortable and durable. Great value for the price,71,0.2432,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,70.7568
2,I buy these for my sons school clothes because he does not like branded shirts; and I notice the quality on these is very high for the price. They wash well; wear well and look good; the slim fit is great and he says they are very comfortable. In my opinion these are the best t shirts for the money out there.,310,0.2108,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,309.7892
3,In this case 'size' is essential. I ordered these t-shirts to sleep in basically. During winter I like to have an oversized t-shirt to sleep in. Ordering online is always risky and especially when it pertains to sizes. Not familiar with this brand so I chose the XX Large shirt just to make sure it would be the size I needed. As it turned out; XX Large was NOT big enough. After I washed them; they shrunk down to what would fit me normally so I cannot use them to sleep in. The quality is good; but the sizing is tricky. I suggest you order something 3 times the size you need.,579,0.1244,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,1,579.1244
4,I recently lost about 45 pounds and was in need of some confidence boosting shirts to wear. These are well made and fit me very well. For reference; i'm 5'6' and about 145 pounds. I bought these shirts in size small. Fit in the arms is great; chest is great; and midsection is as well. If i had any gripe it would be that i could use an extra 1-2' in length after a few washes. That said; though; i can raise both arms and the bottom of the shirts come right above (maybe 1cm) my pant line. I will buy more of these in additional colors.,537,0.1063,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,1,537.1063
5,I bought these for our resident homeless man; so I can't say how they fit or was up. But they felt soft and looked like nice quality. The price was great.,154,0.1651,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,153.8349
6,Buy a bigger size. I tried it on when it arrived and it fit well but after washing in cold and drying on low heat; it shrank and no longer fits.,144,0.0814,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,143.9186
7,The quality of the item was excellent for the price unfortunately it just was too small for me. But I'm definitely reordering a larger size,139,0.2224,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,138.7776

14,Shrunk in dryer. I like them but would get a bigger size next time.,67,0.1329,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,66.8671
15,These shirts shrink a whole size down. They??±e are cheap so not the end of the world but I???normally a medium and bought large. The shrunk to smaller than a medium.,165,0.0989,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,164.9011
16,Was hoping these would fit similarly to the Hanes Slim Fit IQ tees I have; but no dice. Really not slim fit; these were boxy/baggy and basically what I'd expect a large; relaxed/regular fit to be like. I can wear them under hoodies or on laundry days; but definitely not as standalone tee's. They look sloppy. Tried to save a few bucks; learned a lesson.,354,0.1692,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,353.8308
17,I ordered four of these shirts and; even at the low price per shirt; I???pretty disappointed. I washed them once when I got them with cold water and low heat on the dryer; and after that single initial wash the collars of these shirts are already warping/??€aconing?? I???sure I can use these as rags or something if it gets too bad; but I???really disappointed that this happened after one wash cycle. Other than the collar; the shirts are nice. Tagless and lightweight with good color.,486,0.0944,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,485.9056

19,Description says 'lightweight;' but it is really medium weight. There are four extremely irritable tags stitches onto the inside of the shirt that I removed with scissors. Now there are holes in my shirts. For an extra large shirt; the length is barely long enough to stay tucked into my pants. Shirt should have been at least one-inch longer. It would appear that shrinkflation has taken root here.,399,0.0448,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,398.9552

I also use them to swim at the beach without getting sun burned. The colors are really nice. The material feels comfortable. I bought the slim-fit ones. I'll buy these again; but not the slim-fit size.,381,0.1999,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,380.8001

58,The shirts fit well.??They're not too thin.??The only thing I don't like is that the tag is sewn one side of the waist. There's no place to sew a tag that won't be annoying; but that spot is more annoying than the back of the neck. There's already a printed tag; so why not get rid of the other one?,299,0.116,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,298.884
59,Excelentes,10,0.0586,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,9.9414
60,They are of normal quality. I wouldn't rate their material as great cotton. For me; its lowest point is in the length; to be a t-shirt to be used as underwear; it seems to be a very tight length... they should be a little longer.,229,0.1862,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,228.8138

63,If these are slim; I writhe at the idea of what not slim is. These are simply not slim; they are simply t-shirts. If you are looking for a men's t-shirt that is in any way slimmer around the torso ; look somewhere else. If you are looking for a ordinary baggy t-shirt; these are t-shirts; yes.,293,0.1099,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,292.8901

73,Shirts are nice and good quality. But I wish the collars fitted a little tighter and you definitely need to order a size larger than you need because they do shrink when you dry them,182,0.1343,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,181.8657

75,These are great t-shirts for the price. Relatively soft and hold their shape well so they look a bit more dressy with shorts.

78,No. Just no. Sizing if off. The brown one is too snug and the neckline and shoulder area is too weird. I should have heeded Amazon's warning that these are frequently returned. The black on is cut differently to the previous one I bought a few weeks back.,255,0.0921,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,254.9079

81,An outstanding slim fit tshirt. Beautifully crafted. They hold up in the wash and fit well. I have several and find them to be suitable for daily wear; or for layering under a casual shirt.,189,0.1802,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,188.8198
82,The shirts arrived with marks on both but the biggest change from earlier purchases was a decline in weight and quality. Very inexpensive feeling compared with the same shirt bought before.,189,0.1169,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,188.8831
83,The gray doesn't have a good waste. It's loose and feels like cheaper material than the previous shirts I bought.,113,0.1222,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,112.8778

89,I started using these for u dershirts during covid and haven't gone back. They are good quality; durable; and fit very well. Despite many years of use; none of them feel worn out or less durable. I'm very pleased with them.,223,0.2001,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,222.7999

92,These medium weight and well made; and what I expect from a large slim-fit shirt. I'm 6'1' and 182 lbs. with a 41' chest and 33' waist. They are comfortable in the chest and not baggy in the waist; unlike the Amazon Essentials slim-fit shirts that I purchase a few years back; which I would not consider actual slim-fit. I ordered these as work and pajama shirts; but I they fit well enough for casual wear. Great price too.,424,0.1412,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,423.8588

96,Comfy; fits great but it shrinks so much after just 3 washes/dryer runs (of course it could be that I shouldn't have dried them ngl I didn't look at the tag) I do plan on getting more and just not tossing them in the dryer,222,0.1341,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,221.8659
97,Thin cheap t-shirts; great for around the house or working out; but I wouldn't really wear these outside the house. Would probably work well as an undershirt. They shrink a bit and probably won't last more than a couple years.,226,0.1131,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,225.8869
98,The white is perfect; while the fit of the grey T-shirt is a bit off. It's significantly longer than expected; which makes it feel awkward. The neckline and shoulder area are uncomfortable due to excess fabric bunching up. Overall; the fit is disappointing. It is really strange as you would expect both of them to be exactly the same of just different color.,359,0.116,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,358.884
99,These shirts are 60% cotton and 40% polyester; they are not 100% cotton as advertised. Outside of that; they seem to be well made and fit nicely. This shirt design has the potential to get a 5 star rating if the fabric was 100% cotton.,235,0.0684,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,234.9316
100,The amount of thread not attaching to the shirt is just sad; the text ??›mazon essential??are those cheap plastic stickers that you can peel off with nail; also those fall off in the drier after the laundry and stick on you other cloths (was painful when I experienced it from another Amazon essential cloth),307,0.0705,clothes,Amazon Essentials Men's Short S,0,306.9295

26,Best sponge ever. If you have never used a scrub daddy suggest you try them.,76,0.1487,kitchen,Scrub Daddy Scratch-Free Multip,0,75.8513
27,This is the best sponge I have ever used. I figured I???give them a try and see what the hype was about. Thinking they were overpriced and being used to Scotch-Brite Zero Scratch. Now I will never buy a different sponge. The Scrub Daddy outperforms in every area. It???super long lasting; has great scrubbing power; suds; is scratch-free; the holes are super handy; and it doesn???ever smell. However; I am always good at wringing out my sponges. My first sponge from the pack lasted six months and could have still been used; but is falling apart so I figured it was time. To give you an idea of my usage; I???a single guy who meal preps and eats most meals from home; and I hand wash everything. These sponges do well at not holding food. Sometimes some minced garlic can get stuck; but I just pick them out. They don???get stained. The hard cold and soft warm effect is interesting; but dirty dishes always clean easier warm anyway so I never use the sponge cold. I made sure to use my second sponge (blue) for at least a week to confirm the people leaving bad reviews about the blue color just got a bad batch in 2019. Pro tip: be careful not to cut the sponge on the edges of pans; knives; etc. and it will last super long.,1228,0.1199,kitchen,Scrub Daddy Scratch-Free Multip,1,1228.1199

85,They appear stiff at first but then are squeezable when wet. Do a good job cleaning without scratching. Not good for wiping off counters like other sponges; though.,164,0.1127,kitchen,Scrub Daddy Scratch-Free Multip,0,163.8873
86,Maybe you are thinking it???just a sponge; what???the big deal? Think again! It???not an ordinary sponge. First the size; big and thick! The magic? Cold water keeps the sponge firm for aggressive scrubbing. Warm/hot water softens it up for general cleaning. And the colors make it easy to dedicate separate sponges for baths; kitchen; etc. A real powerhouse and shockingly scratch free!
